## Text Classification Project

This project involves the classification of text data that consists of 
URLs and HTML files. The goal is to take as input either a URL or an 
HTML file and predict the subject matter of the text. The categories 
or labels that the model will predict are Webinar, Event, Press 
release, Article, Blog, and MISC. MISC is a catch-all category for 
texts that do not belong to any of the other five categories.
