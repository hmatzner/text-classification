While our AC User Summit is just more than a month away, we are sensitive to our clients' travel and safety. Out of an abundance of caution and concern, we have decided to cancel the 2020 User Summit in the best interest of all involved.  While we hope that we all can and will participate in normal activities as much as possible at this time, this is a unique situation that requires extra consideration for our clients and our employees.  Registration fees will be credited back to all clients who have registered for the Summit.  Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work through unprecedented times together.\""

              " 'faqs for some new features available in the beta wayback machine . the beta wayback machine has some new features including searching to find a website and a summary of types of media on a website .   how can i use the wayback machine ’s site search to find websites ? the site search feature of the wayback machine is based on an index built by evaluating terms from hundreds of billions of links to the homepages of more than 350 million sites . search results are ranked by the number of captures in the wayback and the number of relevant links to the site ’s homepage .   can i find sites by searching for words that are in their pages ? no , at least not yet . site search for the wayback machine will help you find the homepages of sites , based on words people have used to describe those sites , as opposed to words that appear on pages from sites .   can i search sites with text from multiple languages ? yes ! in fact , you can search for any unicode character , e.g. you can search for ❤ ( try clicking on it ) . if you can generate characters with your computer , you should be able to use them to search for sites via the wayback machine . go ahead , try searching for правда   can i still find sites in the wayback machine if i just know the url ? yes , just enter a domain or url the way you have in the past and press the “ browse history ” button .   what is the “ summary of < site > ” link above the graph on the calendar page telling me ? it shows you the breakdown of the web captures for a given domain by content type ( text , images , videos , pdfs , etc . ) in addition , it shows the number of captures , urls and new urls , by year for all the years available via the wayback machine , so you can see how a certain site has changed over time .   what are the sources of your captures ? when you roll over individual web captures ( that pop - up when you roll over the dots on the calendar page for a url ) you may notice some text links shows up above the calendar , along with the word “ why ” . those links will take you to the collection of web captures associated with the specific web crawl the capture came from . every day hundreds of web crawls contribute to the web captures available via the wayback machine . behind each , there is a story about factors like who , why , when and how .     why are some of the dots on the calendar page different colors ? we color the dots , and links , associated with individual web captures , or multiple web captures , for a given day . blue means the web server result code the crawler got for the related capture was a 2nn ( good ) ; green means the crawlers got a status code 3nn ( redirect ) ; orange means the crawler got a status code 4nn ( client error ) , and red means the crawler saw a 5nn ( server error ) . most of the time you will probably want to select the blue dots or links .   can i find sites by searching for a word specific to that site ? yes , by adding in “ site:<domain > ” your results will be restricted to the specified domain . e.g. “ site : gov clinton ” will search for sites related to the term “ clinton ” in the domain “ gov ” .',\n",

              " 'what is page experience and why is it important ? . google continually makes updates to its search algorithm to rank the relevant pages that will be most useful to the users in the search engine results page ( serp ) . if you fail to keep a track of these updates , you may lose your rankings quickly . one such ranking factor that has now gained immense importance is called page experience . let us check out what page experience is and how it may impact your search rankings .   what is page experience ?   “ page experience is a set of signals that measure how users perceive the experience of interacting with a web page beyond its pure information value , both on mobile and desktop devices . ”   in simpler terms , it can be thought of as a metric for measuring the navigation experience and interaction of users on a web page . this means , if you can optimize your web pages in a way that makes it easier for users to navigate and interact with your site , you can rank higher on the relevant keywords .   it is important to note that page experience is not the same as user experience . it is a subset of user experience . it ’s focused on the technical aspects that influence user experience . the key signals include core web vitals , interactivity , web visual stability , mobile friendliness of the page . all these signals are in the control of the web developer team building the website and directly affect the user experience .   why page experience is important ?   according to google , “ google still seeks to rank pages with the best information overall , even if the page experience is subpar . however , in cases where there are many pages that may be similar in relevance , page experience can be much more important for visibility in search . ” it should matter not only because it can impact your rankings but also because of its enormous impact on the overall customer experience .   page experience signals   core web vitals   core web vitals are a set of factors that google considers important in a web page ’s overall user experience . these are made up of three specific user interaction and page speed measurements :   largest contentful paint ( lcp ): it essentially refers to the time it takes to load the web page ’s main content   first input delay ( fid ): it measures the time ( in milliseconds ) from when a user first interacts with your site ( presses a button or clicks a link ) to when the browner responds to the interaction   cumulative layout shift ( cls ): it is a user - centric metric for measuring visual stability . it quantifies how often users experience unexpected layout shifts . a low cls indicates that the page is delightful .   mobile friendliness   it determines the website ’s google readability and usability on mobile devices .   https   it determines a website ’s security status . google favors websites that use the https protocol to protect its users from hackers targeting sensitive information .   intrusive interstitials   it is a form of intrusive marketing . in 2017 , google rolled out an algorithm change , which penalized websites that used intrusive interstitials when users tried to access the websites on mobile devices .   elvin web marketing llc builds websites with user experience in mind . we ’re an seo company that builds websites that are seo friendly out of the box .',\n",

              " 'ahrefs ’ study of 2 million featured snippets : 10 important takeaways . the number of times this article was shared on twitter .   shows estimated monthly search traffic to this article according to ahrefs data . the actual search traffic ( as reported in google analytics ) is usually 3 - 5 times bigger .   shows how many different websites are linking to this piece of content . as a general rule , the more websites link to you , the higher you rank in google .   it looks like we ’re now in the middle of the featured - snippet - geddon that “ seo astrologists ” predicted more than 3 years ago   google is actively rolling out featured snippets for a wide variety of search queries because they want to serve quicker answers to people .   and seo professionals are absolutely excited about this new opportunity because featured snippets give a chance for low - ranking pages to get to the top of search results with almost zero effort .   last year , ahrefs jumped on this bandwagon by intoducing support for all sorts of “ serp features ” in the site explorer and keywords explorer tools .   and today , we have collected enough data to carry out a substantial research of featured snippets and share all our findings with you .   but first …   what is a featured snippet ?   a featured snippet ( otherwise called answer box ) is a brief answer to a user ’s search query , which is displayed on top of google search results . it is extracted from one of the top - ranking pages for that search query and includes that page ’s title and url .   it looks like this :   but that was my own definition . you might also want to know how google themselves describe it .   what makes a featured snippet so enticing ?   if your page is ranking anywhere in the top10 google search results , it has a chance to also get the # 0 spot - a featured snippet .   and the best part is that the amount of effort required to get featured is almost zero ( that is , if you get lucky ) .   i mean , let ’s say that you rank # 7 for some keyword . trudging your way to # 1 would usually be quite challenging and slow . but if there ’s a featured snippet opportunity , you can get there almost instantly with just a few small adjustments on your page .   so let ’s see what ahrefs ’ data tells us about featured snippets and how to take advantage of this awesome opportunity .   1 . how many search queries have a featured snippet ?   when we performed this study , we had ~112 million keywords in our us database , almost ~14 million of which had featured snippets in their serp .   in other words , according to ahrefs ’ data , ~12.29 % of search queries have featured snippets in their search results . ( which is quite a lot , if you ask me . )   performing a study on 14 million keywords would be rather challenging , so most of the experiments below are based on smaller samples ( up to 2 million keywords , depending on the experiment ) .   2 . do featured snippets drive more clicks ?   featured snippets are styled differently from the rest of the search results . they occupy more real estate , and they clearly catch the eye .   so they should attract a lot of clicks , right ?   wrong !   when there ’s a featured snippet at the # 1 position , it only gets ~8.6 % of clicks ( on average ) , while the page that ranks right below it will get ~19.6 % of clicks ( on average ) .   how does it compare to a regular # 1 ranking page with no featured snippet above it ? that page will get ~26 % of all clicks .   in other words , it looks like the featured snippet is stealing clicks from the # 1 ranking result .   sidenote . just in case you want to know a bit more about the details of the above experiment , we only selected search queries that did n’t have any paid ads , and we excluded all branded search queries where the # 1 ranking result had just in case you want to know a bit more about the details of the above experiment , we only selected search queries that did n’t have any paid ads , and we excluded all branded search queries where the # 1 ranking result had sitelinks . sample size : 100k keywords with search volume of at least 100 searches per month .   but , as you may already know , not all searches result in clicks on the search results :   so we also decided to study the “ clicks - to - searches ” ratio for keywords that had a featured snippet in the search results vs those that did n’t .   and here ’s what we ’ve got :   it looks like featured snippets do reduce the overall number of clicks . which is no surprise , actually , since the goal of these featured snippets is to give the searcher an instant answer to their question so they would n’t have to click .   sidenote . please treat the results of the above experiments with a grain of salt because featured snippets are n’t the single contributing factor to both ctr and clicks / volume ratio of a search query . and the numbers vastly vary from keyword to keyword , while we ’re giving you averages across a large sample . but the general takeaways do seem to make a lot of sense nonetheless . please treat the results of the above experiments with a grain of salt because featured snippets are n’t the single contributing factor to both ctr and clicks / volume ratio of a search query . and the numbers vastly vary from keyword to keyword , while we ’re giving you averages across a large sample . but the general takeaways do seem to make a lot of sense nonetheless .   3 . what are the most common ranking positions of featured snippets ?   in the above experiment , we only looked at the search queries where the featured snippet was ranking at the very top of the search results .   but how often does this occur ?   it looks like only 30.9 % of featured snippets rank at the very top . and still , the vast majority of them rank in the top5 quite consistently .   4 . is top10 ranking required to get “ featured ” ?   according to our data , it is 99.58 % positive that google only features pages that already rank in the top10 .   but now you ’re probably wondering what ’s up with these 0.42 % “ outlier ” pages ? the answer is simple : they are taken from some other serp feature , like an answer box .   so it appears there ’s no way to rank in a featured snippet if you do n’t already rank anywhere on the front page of google .   5 . do backlink signals help you get a featured snippet ?   for each individual search query , we compared the backlink metrics of a “ featured ” page vs. median value among the rest of the pages in the top10 organic results .   here ’s what we ’ve got :   in the vast majority of cases , the backlink metrics of a “ featured ” url seem to be on par with the rest of the pages in serp . so google does n’t seem to be featuring “ the strongest ” page in the top10 .   sidenote . dr & ur only measure the overall quality and quantity of incoming backlinks . we did n’t study the anchor texts of these backlinks , or surrounding text , or topical relevance of the linking pages . so we ca n’t advise you to discount all backlink factors at once .   6 . how many featured snippets can a single page rank for ?   the top - performing page in our database owns 4,658 featured snippets !   it ’s this one :   https://authoritynutrition.com/how-to-lose-weight-as-fast-as-possible/   you can browse the search queries where this page is featured using ahrefs ’ site explorer tool .   just go to the “ organic keywords ” report and use the “ features ” filter :   and here are the top10 pages by the amount of featured snippets they rank for :   ( 4658 ) https://authoritynutrition.com/how-to-lose-weight-as-fast-as-possible/ ( 3159 ) http://www.healthline.com/health/rashes ( 3130 ) http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/whats-causing-my-chest-pain ( 3055 ) https://authoritynutrition.com/6-proven-ways-to-lose-belly-fat/ ( 2993 ) https://authoritynutrition.com/12-weight-loss-pills-reviewed/ ( 2918 ) http://www.savethestudent.org/make-money/10-quick-cash-injections.html ( 2354 ) https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/mp3-converter ( 2289 ) https://torrentfreak.com/top-10-most-popular-torrent-sites-of-2016-160102/ ( 2167 ) http://www.healthline.com/health/raised-skin-bump ( 2150 ) https://www.rush.edu/health-wellness/quick-guides/what-is-a-healthy-weight   we already know that a single page can rank in the top10 for thousands of relevant keywords ( see our previous study ) . but it turns out that a single page can also “ be featured ” for thousands of search queries .   7 . which search queries trigger featured snippets ?   let ’s take a closer look at the 2 million search queries with featured snippets that we have randomly selected for this study .   here ’s their distribution by monthly search volume :   somehow , i always thought google only cares to display a featured snippet if the keyword is fairly popular . but it turns out the majority of featured snippets are triggered by long - tail keywords .   this data actually supports the “ create great content ” mantra .   i mean , there ’s almost no way you could purposefully target millions of featured snippets for millions of long - tail keywords .   but if you stick to writing detailed in - depth articles that fill all possible blank spots that people might have , you ’re increasing your chances to rank for a bunch of “ long - tail featured snippets . ”   8 . which words trigger featured snippets ?   here are the top30 most frequently met words among the search queries that trigger featured snippets ( stop words excluded ):   a.j. ghergich has done some great research , studying the relations between types of search queries ( questions , prepositions , comparisons ) and formats of featured snippets ( paragraph , table , list ) .   immediately after reading it , i wanted to know the “ popularity ” of each group of search queries :   to my sincere surprise , the vast majority of keywords that trigger featured snippets did n’t belong to any of the three aforementioned groups .   here are a few examples of keywords from the group “ other ” :   primary taste sensations   verizon lg g2 update   windows 10 compatibility   cocktail weiner recipe   gmat scores range   9 . which websites get “ featured ” most often ?   i ’m sure you wo n’t be surprised if i say that wikipedia is the absolute leader in the amount of featured snippets it owns .   but can you guess the top20 “ most featured ” websites in the united states ?   i do n’t know about you , but i was rather surprised to see youtube as the # 7 “ most featured ” website .   i mean , you do get a large knowledge graph panel with a video in it when you search for some youtube video ( like a katy perry song ) .   but youtube also owns featured snippets for search queries like these :   bromite lewis structure   microsoft access database password recovery   summertime ceiling fan direction   connect hdmi to dvi monitor   how to get to the maelstrom legion   cleaning filter on kitchenaid dishwasher   is the diamond play button real diamond   what is dual band   basically , google is happy to feature the descriptions of relevant youtube videos , even when they are just a few sentences long :   10 . how often does google change featured snippets ?   this one was quite tricky to study because we do n’t update serps for all keywords in our database with the same frequency . the more popular a keyword is , the more often we update it . which means that longer tail keywords might not have their serp updated in 2 - 3 months .   so we took 10,000 of our most frequently updated keywords ( in the united states ) and got this :   how to rank in a featured snippet   i hope you enjoyed our takeaways and now have a much deeper understanding of google ’s featured snippets .   but the most important question was left unanswered :   how do you rank in a featured snippet ?   unfortunately , there ’s no guaranteed way to do it . but there are quite a few things you can try to increase your chances .   we have a full guide to finding and stealing featured snippets here .   1 . secure the featured snippets that you already own .   the odds are your website ranks in a few featured snippets already .   you can easily see that in ahrefs ’ site explorer tool by applying a “ features ” filter to the list of keywords that you rank for :   ( we only rank in 12 featured snippets with ahrefs.com website )   if you do n’t want someone else to steal these featured snippets away from you , you have to make sure that each of your featured snippets perfectly matches its search query .   there are three simple ways to do it :   your content should be awesome and up - to - date ; try to provide both the question and the answer on your page ( make sure both are short enough to fit the “ box ” ) ; match your content to the current format of the snippet ( paragraph , list , table , image ) .   here ’s a great post by richard baxter that shows this strategy in action : optimising for google ’s quick answer box .   2 . look for existing opportunities .   we already know that any page that ranks in the top10 google search results can be “ featured . ”   you can use ahrefs ’ site explorer to quickly find the keywords with featured snippets where your website is ranking in the top10 :   ( looks like there are 195 keywords with featured snippets where ahrefs.com website ranks in the top10 )   the key to winning these snippets from your competitors is n’t in any way different from what i just suggested .   you just have to “ feed ” google a better snippet than what ’s already listed .   some people have reported that using structured markup helps to get featured . at first google confirmed it , but immediately after they said otherwise .   well , according to a recent study from getstat , schema.org markup is actually less common on featured snippet urls than it is on regular search results :   we noted that the code snippet of itemtype=”http://schema.org/ appeared on 15.7 percent of featured snippet urls , but we saw the same markup on 19.6 percent of regular search result urls . wikipedia was the number one domain for featured snippets in our data set and they do n’t use schema.org , which may have skewed our results here .   3 . write in - depth content that helps people   as you just learned from this study , the majority of featured snippets are :   triggered by long - tail keywords ;   triggered by search queries that are n’t categorized as questions , comparisons or prepositions .   this means that the best way to rank for a lot of featured snippets is simply to produce a lot of great content that will address what people are searching for .   and , of course , formatting it in a way where it would be easy for google to pull featured snippets from it .   the end   that ’s all we can tell you about featured snippets as of today . i hope you enjoyed our data and i encourage you to “ steal ” it for your own articles , presentations and client proposals .   as always , if you would like us to study something else about featured snippets , do n’t hesitate to let us know about it in comments . we ’ll see what we can do .',\n",
              " 'keyword research : the beginner ’s guide by ahrefs . part 1 keyword research basics     if you ’re new to seo , you ’re probably wondering what keyword research even is and why it is so important . well , this short chapter is for you . otherwise , just skip to the next one .   what is keyword research ?   keyword research is the process of discovering valuable search queries that your target customers type into search engines like google to look for products , services , and information .   why is keyword research important ?   if you publish a page on a topic that no one is searching for , that article wo n’t receive any traffic from google ( or other search engines ) .   many website owners make that mistake , and it ’s part of the reason why 90.63 % of pages on the internet get no traffic from google , according to our study .   keyword research helps you ensure that there is a search demand for whatever you want to write about . thus , if your page ends up ranking well in google for its target keyword , you ’ll be enjoying a consistent stream of highly targeted visitors to it .   part 2 how to find keyword ideas     keyword research starts from putting yourself in the shoes of your customers . what words and phrases might they use to find solutions to their problems ? plug these into a keyword research tool like ahrefs ’ keywords explorer , and you ’ll find thousands more relevant keyword ideas on top of what you just brainstormed .   it ’s a simple process , but you need two things to do it well :   good knowledge of your industry an understanding of how keyword research tools work   that ’s what this chapter is all about .   1 . brainstorm “ seed ” keywords   seed keywords are the starting point of your keyword research process . they define your niche and help you identify your competitors . every keyword research tool asks for a seed keyword , which it then uses to generate a huge list of keyword ideas ( more on that shortly ) .   if you already have a product or business that you want to promote online , coming up with seed keywords is easy . just think about what people type into google to find what you offer .   for example , if you sell coffee and coffee - making equipment , then your seed keywords might be :   coffee   cappuccino   french press   nespresso   etc   note that seed keywords themselves wo n’t necessarily be worth targeting with pages on your website . as the name suggests , you ’ll use them as “ seeds ” for the next steps in this process . so do n’t obsess too much over your seed keywords . it should only take a few minutes to pinpoint them . as soon as you have a handful of broad ideas related to your website ’s topic , move on to the next step .   2 . see what keywords your competitors rank for   looking at which keywords already send traffic to your competitors is usually the best way to accelerate your keyword research . but first , you need to identify those competitors . that ’s where your brainstormed list of keywords comes in handy . just search google for one of your seed keywords and see who ranks on the front page .   if none of the top - ranking websites for your seed keywords resemble your site ( or where you ’re trying to take it ) , then you should try searching for slightly more specific things .   for example , if you sell coffee - making equipment on your website , you may find more actual competitors in the search results for “ cappuccino maker ” rather than “ cappuccino . ” that ’s because there are mostly e - commerce stores like yours ranking for the former and blogs ranking for the latter .   once you find a competitor website that fits the bill , you should plug it into a competitive intelligence tool like ahrefs ’ site explorer to check which pages bring it the most traffic and what keywords these pages are targeting .   after repeating the process with a few of your competitors , you ’ll find yourself with a pretty sizable list of relevant keywords . and you ’ve barely even started your keyword research !   whether these keyword ideas are purely informational ( i.e. , blog articles ) or have commercial intent ( i.e. , product pages ) is something we ’re going to determine in later stages of our keyword research process . for now , your goal is to collect as many relevant keyword ideas as you can .   make sure to repeat this process for as many competitors as you can . we have a handy report in site explorer , which will help you discover more of them . it ’s called “ competing domains ” and shows you similar websites to the one you ’ve entered based on the common keywords that they rank for in google .   are you seeing a lot of topics you’ve already covered ? if you ’re doing keyword research for an established website , you may find that you ’ve already covered most of your competitors ’ keywords . in this case , you should try using the content gap report in ahrefs ’ site explorer . it finds keywords that one or more of your competitors rank for , but you do n’t . to use it , plug a few of your competitors ’ websites into the top section , then paste your own site into the bottom field and click “ show keywords . ” you can learn more about content gap analysis in this video .   3 . use keyword research tools   competitors can be a great source of keyword ideas . but it ’s very likely that there are many keywords that your competitors have n’t covered yet . you can find these using various keyword research tools .   keyword research tools all work the same way . you plug in a seed keyword , and they pull keyword ideas from their databases based on that keyword .   google keyword planner ( gkp for short ) is perhaps the most well - known keyword tool . it ’s free to use , and although it ’s made for people who want to display paid advertisements in google , you can also use it to find keywords for seo purposes .   here are some keyword ideas that gkp has given me for the seed keyword “ coffee ” :   it is important to note that gkp is capable of generating keyword ideas that do n’t necessarily contain your seed keyword in them . take the keyword “ percolator , ” for example . unless you ’re a hardcore coffee connoisseur , you probably wo n’t know this relates to coffee . which makes gkp quite a useful tool for discovering non - obvious keyword ideas .   and whenever you discover an interesting keyword like that , try using it as your new seed keyword and see what kind of new keyword ideas you ’ll get from it .   beyond keyword planner , there are quite a few other free keyword research tools . these are great if you ’re just starting out , but you ’ll soon realize that they ’re quite limited in terms of data and functionality .   thus , if you decide to commit to growing the search traffic to your website , you may as well skip the free tier and use a “ professional ” keyword research tool . like ahrefs ’ keywords explorer .   let ’s enter a few of our seed keywords and see how many keyword ideas it gives us .   3.9 million keywords ! no free tool will let you work with such a vast number of keyword ideas .   that may seem like an overwhelming number of keywords to work with . and it is . but do n’t worry . you ’ll learn how to narrow them down right in the tool later in this guide .   for now , let me briefly explain the differences between the two main types of keyword idea reports that we have in keywords explorer .   matching terms   this report will only show you the keyword ideas that contain your seed keywords in them . it has two modes : “ terms match ” and “ phrase match . ”   “ terms match ” shows keyword ideas that contain all words of your seed keyword in them , regardless of where exactly they are and what order they ’re in . so if our seed keyword is “ coffee machine , ” we ’ll get the following keyword ideas :   coffee vending machine   vending machine gun kelly coffee shop   “ phrase match ” only returns keyword ideas that have the words of your seed keyword in the exact order as you entered them . like so :   best coffee machine   coffee machine with grinder   related terms   this report will show keyword ideas that do n’t necessarily contain your seed keywords in them . it also has two modes : “ also rank for ” and “ also talk about . ”   “ also rank for ” shows you search queries that the top - ranking pages for your seed keyword also rank for .   also rank for ” shows you search queries that the top - ranking pages for your seed keyword also rank for . “ also talk about ” shows you words and phrases that are frequently mentioned on the top - ranking pages for your seed keywords .   4 . study your niche   everything we ’ve discussed so far is enough to generate an almost unlimited number of keyword ideas . but at the same time , the process kind of keeps you “ in the box . ”   you can solve this by going to the places where your target audience hangs out — industry forums , groups , and q&a sites — and studying their conversations .   for example , here ’s a thread i found on the /r / coffee subreddit :   a quick check in keywords explorer , and i found this search query : “ aeropress coffee to water ratio . ” it only gets 150 searches per month , but the fact that this topic got 42 upvotes on reddit means that people really appreciate this knowledge . plus , the content of that reddit thread can serve as a foundation for my future piece of content .   other than browsing industry forums , your existing customers can also be a great source of keyword ideas . so the next time you talk to them , remember to pay attention to the language they use and the common questions they ask . that might lead you to some original keyword ideas to cover on your website .   part 3 how to analyze keywords     having access to millions of keyword ideas is all well and good . but how do you know which ones are best ? after all , going through them all by hand will be a near - impossible task .   the solution is simple : use seo metrics to narrow things down and separate the wheat from the chaff before adding them to your keyword list .   let ’s explore four keyword metrics you can use to do this .   search volume   search volume tells you the average number of times a keyword gets searched per month . for example , “ donald trump ” has a monthly search volume of 3.1 million in the u.s. alone .   there are four important things to know about the search volume metric :   it ’s the number of searches , not the number of people who searched – there are cases where someone might search for a keyword multiple times a month ( e.g. , “ weather in singapore ” ) . all such occurrences contribute to the search volume of that keyword , even though it ’s the same person making searches . it does n’t equal how many visits it will send you if you rank for it – even if you manage to rank # 1 , your traffic from that one keyword will rarely exceed 30 % of its search volume . and that ’s if you ’re lucky . it ’s an annual average – if there are 120 k searches for a keyword in december and none for the remaining 11 months of the year , its reported monthly search volume will be 10 k ( 120k/12 months ) . it ’s country - specific – keyword tools often display search volume for the selected country . but some of them also have an option to show you the global search volume , which is the sum of search volumes across all countries .   almost every keyword research tool will have a search volume filter to let you focus on the keyword ideas with a specific range of popularity . it has two main use cases :   filtering out super high - volume keywords – if your site is new , then you probably do n’t want to waste your time looking at keywords with 10k+ monthly searches because they ’re likely to be too competitive for you . filtering specifically for lower - volume keywords – perhaps you want to find uncompetitive , low - volume keywords where you can easily get a little bit of traffic . these are often referred to as “ long - tail keywords . ”   long - tail keywords are a household name in seo . and yet they ’re often overlooked . it seems no one wants to go after a keyword unless it gets at least a hundred searches per month . let alone if it comes up as having zero search volume .   such “ zero volume ” keywords will only bring a few visitors per month if you rank for them . but the thing is they add up ! if you publish a hundred articles targeting such keywords , your annual total traffic may actually add up to a few thousand highly targeted visitors .   it ’s a common rookie mistake to disregard low search volume keywords . they ’re just as useful as their more popular counterparts . often even more useful , since they ’re more specific and often have high commercial value .   another important thing to remember about search volumes is that they may vary slightly from tool to tool . that ’s because each tool calculates and updates this metric in different ways .   all in all , search volume is an incredibly important metric in seo . so i highly recommend that you read this dedicated article that i wrote about it .   keep an eye on search volume trends given that search volume is an annual average , it can often lead you astray in terms of the future search demand of a given search query . if some keyword had a big spike in popularity , this would inflate its average search volume while the popularity might actually decline from there . the infamous nft game , axie infinity , had a big spike in search volume in july 2021 . but from there , it ’s only been going downhill . so even though the annual average search volume is reported as a solid 169 k , last month ’s search volume was actually just 39 k and is likely to drop even further in the coming months . if you have n’t heard about it before , google trends is a nice free tool for analyzing trending searches . and we have written a pretty extensive guide on how to use it .   traffic potential   the u.s. search volumes of the following two keywords are nearly equal :   which means that the amount of search traffic that you may get from targeting each of them should also be nearly equal , right ?   well , not quite .   let ’s take the top - ranking pages for each of these keywords and compare how much search traffic they get in the u.s. this can easily be done by copying their urls into ahrefs ’ site explorer .   and it turns out that one of these pages is actually getting nearly 5x more search traffic than the other .   how can that be ?   well , webpages do n’t rank in google for just a single keyword . if you look at the two screenshots above attentively , you ’ll see that the top - ranking page for “ sales page ” is ranking in google for 55 keywords ( check the “ organic keywords ” tile ) . while the top - ranking page for “ submit website to search engines ” ranks in google for a total of 406 different keywords .   here are some of them ( as seen in the organic keywords report in site explorer ):   whatever search query you have in mind , different people will phrase it differently while , essentially , looking for the same thing . google is smart enough to understand that . and it , therefore , ranks the same page for all these similar search queries .   we studied this “ phenomenon ” back in the day , and it turned out that the average top - ranking page would also rank for about a thousand similar keywords .   this means that you should not blindly rely on the search volume of a single keyword when estimating the search traffic that your page is going to get if it ranks for it . what you need to do instead is examine the top - ranking pages for that keyword and see how much search traffic they get in total from all the variations of that keyword , which they rank for .   here at ahrefs , we thought it was such an important thing to consider when analyzing keywords that we have developed a dedicated metric to address it .   it ’s called “ traffic potential , ” and it shows how much search traffic the top - ranking page for your keyword gets .   in ahrefs ’ keywords explorer , the traffic potential metric is located right next to the search volume . this saves you lots of time looking up what page ranks # 1 for that keyword and how much search traffic it gets in total .   both the search volume and traffic potential metrics are country - specific , though . so if you need to gauge the worldwide search traffic of a top - ranking page , you ’ll need to use site explorer with “ all countries ” mode selected .   keyword difficulty   experienced seo professionals typically gauge the ranking difficulty of each keyword manually . that is , by looking at the search results for each keyword and analyzing them . they account for many different factors to judge how hard or easy it ’ll be to rank :   search intent   content depth , relevance , freshness , authority   number ( and quality ) of backlinks   domain rating   serp features   etc   this process varies from person to person , and there ’s no consensus on precisely what is and is n’t important here .   one person might believe that domain rating is important , and another might think that relevance plays more of a role .   the opinions might also vary depending on the type of search query that they ’re analyzing , because for different kinds of queries google gives preference to different things .   all of that makes life a little difficult for seo tool creators , who try to distill the complex and intricate concept of ranking difficulty down to a simple two - digit number .   but after talking to many professional seos about the signals that an actionable keyword difficulty ( kd ) score should factor in , we realized that everyone agreed on at least one thing : backlinks are very important for ranking .   so , in the end , we decided to base our keyword difficulty ( kd ) score on the number of unique websites linking to the top 10 ranking pages .   as you can see in the image above , kd relates to the estimated number of linking websites your page needs to rank in the top 10 .   did you get that ? it ’s not the estimated number of linking websites you need to rank # 1 . it ’s the estimated number you need to rank in the top 10 . getting to # 1 is an entirely different battle .   many people misuse the kd metric by setting the filter from 0 to 10 and focusing solely on the easy keyword ideas . but here ’s why avoiding high - kd keywords might be a mistake :   you should go after high - kd keywords sooner , not later – you ’ll need lots of backlinks to rank for high - kd keywords , which takes a lot of time and resources . so it pays to create your page and begin promoting it as soon as possible . the sooner you start , the sooner you ’ll get there . look at high - kd keywords as link opportunities – the fact that the top - ranking pages for some keywords have lots of backlinks is a sign of a “ link - worthy ” topic . if you create something original on that topic , there ’s a good chance lots of people will link to you .   the bottom line is this : kd is not there to deter you from targeting specific keywords . it ’s there to help you understand what it ’ll take to rank for a given query ( as well as the “ link - worthiness ” of a given topic ) .   just know that you should always manually assess keywords before going after them and not rely solely on any tool ’s difficulty score to make your final decision . no single score can distill the complexity of google ’s ranking algorithm into a single number . be wary of tool creators who suggest otherwise .   cost per click ( cpc )   cost per click ( cpc ) shows how much advertisers are willing to pay for a click on an ad displayed on top of search results for a given keyword . it ’s more a metric for advertisers than seos , but it can serve as a useful proxy for a keyword ’s value .   for example , the keyword “ project management software ” has a pretty high cpc of $ 30 . that ’s because people searching for it seem to be looking for a product to buy .   but it ’s a different story for “ project management methodologies . ” this is clearly an informational search query , and the odds of selling your project management software to these people are not as high — hence , the much lower cpc of $ 6 .   one important thing to know about cpc is that it ’s much more volatile than search volume . while the search demand for most keywords stays roughly the same from month to month , their cpc can change any minute as more companies display ads for them .   this means that the cpc values that you see in various seo tools are merely snapshots in time and are n’t particularly precise . if you want to get real - time cpc data , it is recommended that you use adwords .   part 4 how to target keywords     a very important step in analyzing keywords is to identify what kind of page you ’ll need to create in order to maximize your chances to rank . and if you can use that page to target a group of relevant keywords all at once . or perhaps create a few additional pages to target some of the keywords individually .   let ’s explore how you determine those things .   1 . identify the parent topic   let ’s say that you ’ve got the following keywords on your list :   all of these search queries seem to be talking about the same topic : “ whipped coffee . ” but does that mean that a single page can rank well for all these keywords ? or perhaps you ’ll need to create individual pages to target each of them separately ?   the answer largely depends on how google sees these keywords . does it see them as part of the same topic ? or does it see them as individual topics ?   you can get a sense of this by searching for each of these keywords one by one and comparing the search results . for example , let ’s compare the search results for the keyword “ whipped coffee ” with those of the keyword “ whipped coffee recipe ” :   the top - ranking pages for both keywords are nearly identical . this means that google sees the search query “ whipped coffee recipe ” as a subtopic of a more general query , “ whipped coffee . ” so you can rank for both keywords with a single page .   now let ’s compare the search results for “ whipped coffee ” with those of “ whipped coffee without sugar ” :   this time , there ’s absolutely no crossover between the two serps . that means that “ whipped coffee without sugar ” is n’t part of a broader “ whipped coffee ” topic . or at least google does n’t think so . which means that you ’ll need to create two separate pages if you want to target both of these keywords .   comparing the search results for seemingly related keywords is a great way to understand how closely related they are and if you should target them with one page or multiple pages . but doing this for hundreds of keywords can be a rather daunting task .   that ’s why we developed a handy feature in keywords explorer , which helps you to identify if a keyword you ’re looking at is a part of a broader topic or , rather , deserves a dedicated page of its own .   we call it the parent topic .   the way we identify the parent topic of a keyword is very simple . we take the page that ranks # 1 for that keyword and look up if there ’s a more popular search query that it gets search traffic from .   so for the keyword “ whipped coffee recipe , ” we have identified that its top - ranking page is also ranking at the top for a more popular keyword , “ whipped coffee . ” which is n’t the case for the keyword “ whipped coffee without sugar . ” it turned out to be a parent topic to itself .   the parent topic functionality is extremely helpful for grouping large lists of keywords into the so - called topical clusters . but we do n’t recommend that you follow it blindly . and here ’s why .   in the screenshot above , keywords explorer says that the search query “ what is whipped coffee ” is a subtopic of “ whipped coffee . ” which means that you do n’t need to create a dedicated page if you want to rank for it .   but let ’s take a look at the top - ranking pages for the “ what is whipped coffee ” keyword :   right at position # 3 , we see a page that is optimized precisely for targeting that specific search query “ what is whipped coffee . ” while the pages above and below it are actually targeting a more general term : “ whipped coffee recipe . ”   thus , if you feel that a certain subtopic may actually deserve a dedicated page of its own , just take the risk and go for it ! it may very well pay off .   2 . study the search intent   let ’s say that you have the following keywords on your list :   now you need to understand which should be best targeted with informational blog articles and which should be product or category pages .   for some keywords , this is obvious . you would n’t create a product page for “ how to brew cold brew coffee ” because searchers are clearly looking for a tutorial .   but what about a keyword like “ arabica coffee ” ? do searchers want information , or do they want to buy some ? in seo , we call this studying the search intent .   google , presumably , has some ways of identifying what exactly searchers want to see for any given search query . and whatever page satisfies the search intent best tends to float to the top of the search results . so the way you determine the search intent behind some keywords is by looking at the top - ranking pages .   let ’s look at the serp for “ arabica coffee ” :   here we have both : informational pages and online shops . in seo , we call this a fractured search intent . it means that you may be able to rank for this keyword with any of the two page types .   but pinpointing the right search intent does n’t end with identifying the right page type for a particular query . ideally , you want to factor in the following variables :   type – for example , blog post , product page , category page , landing page , online tool , etc . format – for example , guide , listicle , news , review , comparison , etc . angle – that ’s your unique spin on a given topic .   here ’s a nice example of a dominant content angle . in the search results for “ how to make latte , ” someone has focused on making a perfect one , while someone else has decided to share how it can be done without an espresso machine .   but what if you tried the following angle for your own article : “ how to make a latte like gordon ramsay . ” maybe some people would consider this to be better than “ perfect ” and click on your page ?   as you can tell , the reason why you need to analyze the search intent of a keyword is to not necessarily follow it to a t.   if you have a strong opinion about the search intent of a given search query but none of the top - ranking pages seem to follow it , give your intuition a chance . even if your page is different from what ’s already there , google may give it a chance and show it to some of the searchers . and if they happen to like it , your page will secure its spot on the serp .   part 5 how to prioritize keywords     prioritizing your list of keywords and deciding where you should invest your efforts first is probably the least straightforward and extremely “ individual ” part of the keyword research process .   there are just too many things to consider :   what is the estimated traffic potential of this keyword ?   what ’s the ranking difficulty ? who are you competing against ?   what will it take to create a perfect page ? or maybe you already have one , and it needs to be improved ?   what ’s the business value of this keyword ? what would you get from ranking for it ?   that last point is a particularly important one . while search volume , traffic potential , ranking difficulty , and search intent are all important considerations , you also need to factor in what ranking for this keyword will be worth to your business .   how to gauge the “ business potential ” of a keyword   many marketers judge the value of a keyword by mapping it to the so - called buyer ’s journey , i.e. , a process people go through before making a purchase . conventional wisdom says the earlier people are in their journey , the less likely they are to buy .   here ’s one popular buyer ’s journey framework :   top of the funnel ( tofu ) – people are looking for general information about the subject .   – people are looking for general information about the subject . middle of the funnel ( mofu ) – people are researching available solutions to their problem .   – people are researching available solutions to their problem . bottom of the funnel ( bofu ) – people are looking to make a purchase of a specific product or service .   tofu keywords tend to have high search volumes but low conversion rates ( i.e. , “ keyword research , ” which has 5,700 monthly searches ) . while bofu keywords are extremely lucrative but their search volumes are much lower ( i.e. , “ best keyword research tool , ” which has 800 monthly searches ) .   at ahrefs , we think that this kind of framework is rather limiting and perhaps even misleading .   here are three reasons why :   first , the fact that someone is looking for a tofu term like “ keyword research ” does n’t mean that you ca n’t promote your product to them . ( which is exactly what i did in this very article with all the mentions of our keywords explorer . )   second , it ’s quite challenging to assign each keyword a definitive tofu , mofu , or bofu label because things are n’t always that clear - cut . for example , “ best keyword research tool ” could be a mofu or bofu keyword for us . it depends on how you look at it .   third , some marketers broaden their definition of tofu to such a degree that they end up covering completely unrelated topics . for example , the folks at hubspot have written articles targeting the following keywords : “ famous quotes , ” “ ice breaker games ” and , most hilarious of all , “ shrug emoji . ”   here at ahrefs , we ’ve developed our own way of determining the business value of a keyword .   we call it “ business potential , ” and it ’s a simple score from 0 to 3 , which indicates how easy it will be to pitch our product while covering a given keyword .   to be completely honest with you , we do sometimes have internal debates within our team when we ’re scoring our blog topics according to this scale . and yet we still prefer it to any of these conventional “ buyer ’s journey ” frameworks .   which keywords should you start working on first ?   unfortunately , there ’s no straightforward answer to this question . as seos like to say , “ it depends . ”   are you working on a brand - new website or an established business ?   are you the only marketer , or do you manage a large team ?   are you responsible for the actual conversions or providing new leads to the sales team ?   how fast do you need to show results ?   keyword research is an act of balancing your unique circumstances with a set of metrics and concepts , which we ’ve just covered : traffic potential , keyword difficulty , business potential , and search intent .   in some cases , your job will be to get as much traffic as possible as fast as possible , which comes down to finding the high - volume , low - difficulty keywords . other times , you ’ll need to focus on leads or conversions , in which case business potential will be the most important metric to focus on .   keyword research is not the process of finding “ easy to rank for ” keywords . it ’s the process of finding the keywords that make the most sense to your business .   you should also have short- , medium- , and long - term ranking goals . if you only focus on short - term goals , you ’ll never rank for the most lucrative keywords . if you only focus on medium- and long - term goals , it ’ll take years to get any traffic .   part 6 keyword research tools     keyword research is practically impossible to do without specialized tools . and if you ’re only starting out or have a tight budget , here are some free keyword research tools for you :   google search console – it shows all of the search queries that your website is currently ranking for and getting clicks from .   – it shows all of the search queries that your website is currently ranking for and getting clicks from . ahrefs webmaster tools – this is our free plan , which is very similar to google search console . but other than showing you what keywords your website is ranking for , we also show you their keyword difficulty ( kd ) scores .   – this is our free plan , which is very similar to google search console . but other than showing you what keywords your website is ranking for , we also show you their keyword difficulty ( kd ) scores . google keyword planner – it ’s a tool for those who want to run ads in google . but seos , too , can get some value from using it .   – it ’s a tool for those who want to run ads in google . but seos , too , can get some value from using it . keyword generator – our free tool for generating keyword ideas .   – our free tool for generating keyword ideas . keyword difficulty checker – our free tool for checking the ranking difficulty of a keyword .   and once you get truly serious about growing the search traffic of your website , make sure to sign up for ahrefs and give keywords explorer a spin . this tool has pretty much everything you need to perform expert - level keyword research and discover some lucrative keyword ideas .   key takeaways',\n",
              " 'how to write the perfect meta description . the number of times this article was shared on twitter .   shows estimated monthly search traffic to this article according to ahrefs data . the actual search traffic ( as reported in google analytics ) is usually 3 - 5 times bigger .   shows how many different websites are linking to this piece of content . as a general rule , the more websites link to you , the higher you rank in google .   the meta description is an html attribute used to describe what a page is about . it can appear in search results as a snippet under the title tag to provide more context .   here ’s how the code snippet looks :   < meta name=\"description \" content=\"site explorer runs on a huge database of 12 trillion links and 402 million tracked keywords to give you the most complete seo data about any website or url . \" >   even though the meta description attribute is not a ranking factor and google shows it in search results only 37 % of the time , it ’s still a part of on - page seo that content publishers often encounter .   in this guide , you ’ll learn how to create great meta descriptions fast and how to audit them efficiently . but first , let me explain why meta descriptions still matter despite their seemingly low seo importance .   new to on - page seo ? check out our beginner ’s guide to on - page seo   why meta descriptions still matter   having a compelling meta description entices more people to click on your website in the search results . that ’s important , even though google only shows meta descriptions in 37 % of the time .   for example , if your page gets 50,000 impressions a month , google shows the meta description for 18,500 of those impressions on average . increasing your ctr from 4 % to just 4.5 % in this instance would result in almost 100 more clicks .   so while you should n’t obsess over meta descriptions , it ’s still worth spending a minute of your time on pages where ‘ yes ’ is the answer to at least one of these questions :   is the page meant to drive organic traffic ?   is it likely to be shared on social media ?   that second question probably needs an explanation .   you see , when a page is shared on social media , it pulls the description from open graph meta tags .   but if you have n’t set an og or twitter description , it pulls the meta description instead . so if you ’re only willing to make an effort to set one of these tags , it should be the meta description .   onto the creation process . …   how to write a meta description   follow these five steps to create your meta descriptions quickly and easily :   let ’s get into it .   1 . expand on your title tag   always think about the description as something that complements the title tag . titles should summarize a page using a few main keywords that characterize the topic . the meta description offers a chance to expand on that further .   in the case above , the short description motivates users to click on our broken link checker because :   it checks pages and websites .   it takes internal and external links into account .   the tool is fast .   it ’s not a lead generation trap ; you can use it on the page right away .   do n’t worry about shoehorning keywords here . it ’s more important that you create something that connects with the reader and entices the click . use your usps where suitable .   2 . match search intent   search intent is the ‘ why ’ behind a query . in other words , what are most people looking for when they search for your main keyword ?   do they want information ?   do they want to buy something ?   are they looking for a specific website ?   do they want a quick answer to a question ?   you can use the search results as a proxy for this . google strives to provide the most relevant results for searchers , so look for commonalities amongst the snippets of top - ranking pages .   for example , almost every result for “ meta description ” shows a definition in the snippet …   … so we ’ll go with that as well .   other serps may not be as straightforward , but you can always pick up on some clues . let ’s take a look at “ how to tie a tie ” :   all the snippets talk about different types of knots , and most mention how the post includes step - by - step instructions . that tells us these things are probably important to searchers and are worth including in a meta description .   just be careful with mixed intent serps like “ standing desk . ”   you can see that there ’s a mix of results here . some are blog posts reviewing the best standing desks , and others are product category pages from online stores .   in cases like this , you should take inspiration from the page snippets that most closely align with the type of content you ’re publishing . if you ’ve written a blog post about standing desks , look at the review and comparison posts . if you ’ve created an ecommerce category page , look at those .   3 . use active voice   active voice improves clarity and entices the click by addressing the searcher directly .   here ’s an example :   you can see that it starts with a verb and makes the searcher the subject of the sentence . in other words , it ’s the searcher who ’s performing the action .   now look at this :   compared to the first example , it ’s dull and demotivating . that ’s because it ’s written in the passive voice .   sidenote . i wrote that as a bad example to make the point . it ’s not a real description . i wrote that as a bad example to make the point . it ’s not a real description .   of course , it ’s not always wise to write meta descriptions in an active voice . case in point : definition - style descriptions . but as a general rule of thumb , passive voice is more the exception than the rule .   learn more about the difference between active and passive voice here .   4 . be concise   meta descriptions are not a place for storytelling . every word matters because users quickly decide what to click on by skimming the results and because descriptions truncate after a certain length .   right now , that length is 920px ( ~160 characters ) on desktop and 680px ( ~120 characters ) on mobile . your best bet to keep them within length is to use a tool like this one , or a wordpress seo plugin like yoast with the functionality built - in .   whether you ’re better off optimizing for mobile or desktop users depends on your audience . if you generally go for longer descriptions for desktop users , make sure to get to the point by ¾ of the length so even mobile users can see it .   what ’s the takeaway here ? be concise for users , not search engines . the length limit is a good signal that there might be unnecessary words .   5 . deploy the meta description   if you ’re using a cms , this is super easy . in wix , squarespace , shopify , and most others , you ’ll find a place to type or paste your meta description in the backend .   in wordpress , plugins like yoast and rankmath add this same functionality .   if you do n’t use a cms , just paste the meta description tag into the < head > section of your html code .   recommendation if you ’re adding the meta description straight into the code , do n’t use quotation marks in the description itself because it will break things . instead , use the html entity \" so it looks like this : < meta name=\"description \" content=\"just showing how to use \" quotation marks \" in meta description . \" > if you use quotation marks when adding a meta description in cms and plugins , they will usually take care of the html transcoding for you .   how to prioritize meta description creation and editing   during the publishing process is not the only time you should take meta descriptions into account . you might already have pages that have a bad meta description or none at all .   there ’s no point in auditing your whole website for meta descriptions . instead , focus on pages that get the most search traffic . that ’s when a better meta description can make a real difference .   you can find these pages in ahrefs webmaster tools . just make a free account , run a crawl with site audit , then go to page explorer and apply these filters :   next , click on the “ manage columns ” button and select “ organic traffic , ” “ meta description , ” and “ meta description length ” :   finally , sort the pages by their organic traffic :   now you ’re looking at your most important meta descriptions . check for those that are n’t great or that are missing entirely .   while i recommend this “ catch - all ” method , you can also choose only to check missing meta descriptions . and that ’s even easier as they ’re reported directly in the on - page report :   click on the “ view affected urls ” button to open the report and sort the pages by organic traffic to get the prioritization right :   that was a pretty easy audit , right ? what about some more writing inspiration ?   great meta description examples   let ’s wrap things up with a few examples of well - crafted meta descriptions across industries and search intents .   1 . healthline   most searchers are seemingly looking for a definition here , so that ’s what this meta description shows . it then prompts the reader to learn more about the benefits of glycine by clicking . simple and efficient .   2 . timeout   i thought that i would see mixed results of neighborhoods and hotels here , but the search results predominantly focus on prague ’s areas . and this description matches intent perfectly . it offers a solution in a concise , lighthearted , and actionable manner . mentioning “ five best “ neighborhoods also tells the search they wo n’t have to spend an age reading it .   3 . patagonia   here , the searcher is looking for sale items . i like the urgency signal initially ; it feels more original and less aggressive than these tend to be . then you see an affirmation of what you came for , ending with patagonia ’s distinctive asset : supporting sustainability and conservation .   4 . nordstrom   this is the epitome of a great e - commerce category page in the search results . it ’s probable that nordstrom lists their most popular types of coats and brands here . free shipping is also likely a usp in these serps as only one other result mentioned it .   5 . shopify   our last example is a homepage . this a category of its own because you have to reflect your brand and what you do . shopify does this well . it ’s clear and prompts you to try the service for free .   your homepage is the only page where i ’d advise spending more time on the meta description because it mostly appears for branded queries where the intent is clear . as a result , google is more likely to show the meta description in the serps .   final thoughts   meta descriptions are one of the first topics most people encounter upon entering the world of seo . luckily , it ’s also one of the easiest to understand and master , so you wo n’t ever have to spend much time on it .   for more things that move the needle in seo , check out our list of actionable seo tips .   got any questions ?

              " 'how often does google rewrite meta descriptions ?

you got it .   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naiwg8883uo   1 . use the correct email address   this first tip may seem like a total no - brainer , but give me a chance to explain .   too many people rely on some automated tools to scrape ( or sometimes even guess ) their outreach prospects ’ email addresses instead of investing a bit of time to research a person manually and find his actual email .   for example , my own email address is listed on our team page for everyone to see : [ email protected ]   but some people prefer to send their emails to a non - existent [ email protected ] , which are picked up by our catchall :   i ignore these emails in 99 % of cases .   the fact that a person did n’t bother to find my real email tells me he ’s not that interested in getting in touch with me . so i ’m not interested in replying either .   if you need a good process of finding email addresses , check out our recent article : “ 8 actionable ways to find anyone ’s email address . ”   2 . think what ’s in it for them   you want a link , you want a tweet , you want to be featured in front of their audience . but what will they get out of it ?   if you do n’t provide value and only ask them to do something for you , your success rate is going to be extremely low .   here ’s how you can make your outreach about them :   show them something new & valuable   if you have something truly unique and outstanding , influencers might appreciate a heads up .   and besides , people with large audience need a constant flow of awesome content to cater to their fans , so they will be grateful if you show them something of value .   but let ’s face it , sharks and big fish are super hard to impress . the stuff that seems unique and outstanding to you might easily be old - school for them .   research your topic well before contacting top people in your field and be realistic about the novelty and uniqueness of your offering .   once you define what makes your content unique , make sure to clearly articulate it in your email so you can pique their interest .   here ’s an example of my own outreach email :   i did n’t just say , “ check out my amazing research of guest blogging . ” i actually explained what i did there and shared a few quick takeaways from my article .   this helps the recipient evaluate whether your content is worth checking out and reduces the chances you ’ll waste their time on an article they view as only “ average . ”   feature them   it ’s incredibly hard to resist checking out a piece of content when you know it talks about you . so why not use this to your advantage ?   remember that a person ’s name is , to that person , the sweetest and most important sound in any language dale carnegie   if you see a way to feature a well - known person ( or their business ) in your article , do it and let them know about it .   this can be anything really :   a quote from their article , podcast or talk   some feedback about the things you ’ve learned from them   a positive experience with their product , service or company   if you make them look good , they ’ll want to tell their audience about it :   3 . only use your best work   we have 300 + articles on the ahrefs blog and most of them are very good , but we only do outreach for a handful of the very best ones ( most of them are featured on our blog homepage ) .   this aligns with the tip that i just shared above : “ show them something new & cool . ”   you only have one chance to make a good first impression on the top people in your industry . do you really want to blow it by sending them your “ average ” article ? i hope not .   but the reality is , most people think every article they publish is a masterpiece . that ’s why influencers ’ mailboxes are flooded with content that ’s anything but special .   so how do you make sure your outstanding article wo n’t get buried in that pile of “ average ” ?   provide social proof   is there anything about your article that would prove you ’re not the only person who thinks it ’s cool ?   did it generate 100 + comments ?   did it get tons of upvotes on reddit ?   did someone famous tweet it ?   did you get cited by authority website in your niche ?   anything along these lines will make your outreach email stand out massively .   take a look at my example :   try to get some initial traction with your article and then use it as your social proof when reaching out to people .   4 . re - think your outreach excuse   here are the 3 most common excuses that i see people use for outreach :   you tweeted this post , and i wrote a similar one …   you published this post , and i wrote a similar one …   you linked to this post , and i wrote a similar one …   why would anyone want to check out a post that ’s similar to what they just read ?   “ similar article ” is a very poor excuse , and it shows you did n’t study the person you ’re reaching out to .   a decent excuse would look like this :   you tweeted this post , and i thought you ’d be interested in checking out a different opinion on that topic . in a nutshell it ’s all about xxx and you can read about it here …   you wrote this post , but you did n’t mention one very important aspect . i ’m talking about xxx and i ’ve explained it in this article …   you linked to this post , and i thought i should show you a much better resource on that subject . it ’s better because xxx …   i ’m pretty sure the difference is clear .   but to come up with an excuse like that , you ’ll have to actually skim through the post they wrote / linked to / tweeted and figure out how your own article is different from it .   most people never bother to study their outreach prospects , and this is how they find themselves featured as bad outreach examples :   reading every article before you reach out and figuring a proper excuse for outreach might sound like a ton of work .   but that ’s only the case when your article is n’t unique enough .   let me explain what i mean with an example .   in our recent article , we called out seo professionals for popularising a wrong definition for the term “ long tail keywords ” and shared the right one .   guess what kind of excuse we ’re using in our outreach template for that article ?   hey % first name% , i noticed that you ’ve mentioned a concept of “ long tail keywords ” in your recent post about { post topic } . here at ahrefs we believe that the definition of the term “ long tail keywords ” in 2017 needs to be revisited . as well as the actual strategy of getting traffic from them . please check out our recent post for more details : https://ahrefs.com/blog/long-tail-keywords/ given that you have a lot of experience in the seo field , it would be interesting to know what you think about it . thanks in advance !   in other words , if your content is offering something really unique , it wo n’t be too hard to craft a good outreach excuse .   5 . throw away your outreach templates   as you can probably tell by now , there ’s no way to scale your outreach while maintaining the quality .   it ’s too easy for your recipients to see when your email is automated and therefore ignore it .   i have no hard feelings when i throw automated outreach emails into the trash can . i know hundreds of other people have received the exact same email and most of them did n’t bother to reply .   do n’t get me wrong , i ’m not advocating against templates — there ’s no way to email 100 + people about the same thing and write your email from scratch every time .   i ’m only trying to say you should spend more time crafting a template that does n’t look like one and leave some room for personalization .   here are a few tips to consider :   do n’t use generic subject lines   let ’s go back to the subject of the email i shared above .   subject : hi tim , compliment on one of your posts   does n’t this look sleazy right off the bat ? i did n’t open the email yet , but i ’m already sceptical .   my favourite approach to email subjects is to keep them short and not too obvious .   example :   subject : ahrefs link building advice   you can clearly tell that this subject has something to do with link building and ahrefs .   but what exactly ?   is there some problem with their backlink profile ?   am i offering them some link building advice ?   am i asking them for link building advice ?   you ’ll never know until you open the email and learn that i am asking you to check out our amazing noob - friendly guide to link building .   avoid patterns   when people use outreach automation software , they often follow an easy - to - distinguish pattern .   it usually goes like this :   hey % first_name% , i just came across your article : % url_of_their_article% it ’s an amazing piece of content and i learned a lot from it . i noticed that you linked to this post : % url_where_they_link_to% it ’s a great post , but i wrote an even better article on that same topic . check it out here : % url_of_my_article% i hope you can add a link to my post in your article or at least tweet it . thanks !   whenever i see an email structured in a similar manner , i realize that there ’s some automation in place , which gives me the moral right to ignore it .   here ’s an example of a template we use at ahrefs :   hey % first_name% , i just stumbled upon your article about { what their article is about } { try to say something smart about their article : feedback , compliments , jokes , etc } i figured you might be interested in checking out our ( ahrefs ) “ noob guide ” to link building : https://ahrefs.com/blog/link-building/ obviously you ’re not a noob , and it is unlikely that you ’ll find anything groundbreaking there . but i ’m pretty sure that you get some “ noob ” questions about link building now and then , so perhaps you ’ll find our guide good enough to share it with these people , instead of trying to explain everything on your own . in this guide we have featured all the major link building strategies and even did an industry survey to figure out which were the most popular and most effective ones . oh , and if you think our guide is lacking something - we ’ll be happy to revise it . so yeah , looking forward to your feedback . and thanks in advance ! -tim   that is still a template , but it leaves room for a lot of personalization and it does n’t follow any obvious pattern .   other than this one :   mention which article of theirs made you reach out . give feedback about that article ( if any ) . plug your own article . explain what makes your article unique and why they should care to check it out . ask for feedback .   if you follow this pattern , you will create a unique outreach template for every new piece of content .   and if you ask me , i would n’t dare to delete an outreach email like this one   quit stupid flattery   everyone loves to be praised , right ? that is why every outreach template that you ’ll find will start with a few words of praise .   and it ’s usually ugly as hell :   i just read your article and it is very cool .   i ’m a long - time reader of your blog and i think your content is totally amazing .   thanks for posting your outstanding article about % topic% , i ’ve learned a lot from it .   you should never use this kind of templated flattery in your outreach emails .   either say something meaningful , or do n’t say anything .   here are some good examples :   i loved your advice on doing xxx . i ’m totally going to implement it this month .   your story of xxx is totally inspiring . i ’ve just shared it with couple of my friends .   your take on xxx totally rocks ! i never thought of it this way !   that “ xxx ” part was highlighted for a reason . by adding context , you show them that your flattery is not templated , but you actually took time to study their work .   nick churick is pretty good at that :   6 . show them you know them   if you take time to dig a little to learn more about the person you ’re reaching out to , your chances of getting a response from them will go through the roof .   i mean , if you cared to spend your time learning about me and you showed it in your outreach email , i ’d feel like a total ass if i did n’t reply .   look again at the email example i shared earlier :   i knew that jimmy was a fan of epic guides , because he recently published an “ epic guide to email marketing . ” and this allowed me to send him a personalized outreach email .   7 . timing is your friend   just because someone wrote an article about something a few years ago , it does n’t mean they still care about it today .   and there ’s almost no chance you can get them to update that old article and link to you .   but the opposite is also true .   if the article was published just yesterday , its author is an easy outreach target .   here ’s a screenshot that shows how brian dean updated his newly published article with 22 more tools , shortly after it was posted to inbound.org :   that ’s because he got a ton of outreach emails with tool suggestions immediately after publishing his article .   do you think you can make him add your tool to the list if you email him now ?   the chances are very slim .   he has already moved on to something else and wo n’t get back to that article anytime soon .   pro tip use ahrefs alerts to track when people publish articles on your topic ( or link to your competitors ) and reach out immediately .   8 . ask wisely   asking for favours is an art . but most people never give it a second thought and act as if everyone owes them something .   here are a couple of rules we follow at ahrefs when reaching out to people :   do n’t ask for tweets   it ’s obvious , that you ’re reaching out because you want some exposure for your piece . you know it and your recipient knows it too .   but as soon as you ask for it directly , two things happen :   your email is no longer about giving value to them . it ’s about asking for a favour to you . if they do n’t want to tweet your article , you ’re putting them in a difficult situation .   i hate to tell people , “ no , i wo n’t tweet your article . ” i ’d rather not reply their email at all .   but if i like your content , i will tweet it , even if you did n’t ask me to :   ask for links   unlike with tweets , people do require a soft nudge if you want them to link to you .   but you have to make sure you ’re giving them an easy way out , in case they do n’t want to do it .   just frame your request like this :   let me know what you think about the post . maybe it ’s worth mentioning in your article ( or in future ones ) ?   would love to know your opinion on that article . and if you ’ll find it useful , please consider linking to it from that post of yours , or perhaps mentioning it in your future writing .   you ’re still clearly asking for a link , but you ’re making your request easy to ignore , if a person does n’t want to do it .   9 . follow up , once   quite often people do n’t respond , not because they do n’t want to but because they forgot to .   this can be solved with a short polite follow up :   hey % first_name% , just a quick follow up in case you ’ve missed my email . if you ’re short on time right now - no worries . i wo n’t bug you about it again . thanks . -tim   that ’s it .   please do n’t send more follow ups .   seriously :   do n’t be that guy .   level up your outreach game   i sincerely hope this article makes you reconsider your outreach strategies .   do n’t shoot yourself in the foot . be genuine and provide real value to the person you ’re reaching out to .   there ’s a human like you on the other side of the screen . always remember that .   and should you get a bad outreach email in your inbox , just reply to them with a link to this post 😉',\n",
              " 'seos are breaking pagination after google changed rel = prev . shows estimated monthly search traffic to this article according to ahrefs data . the actual search traffic ( as reported in google analytics ) is usually 3 - 5 times bigger .   shows how many different websites are linking to this piece of content . as a general rule , the more websites link to you , the higher you rank in google .   when google announced that rel = prev / next markup had n’t been used in years , we noticed an increase in websites changing their implementation and actively harming their sites . let ’s look at what changed and what you should be doing .   the purpose of rel = prev / next is to indicate paginated pages in a series . google originally used the markup to share signals with the group of paginated pages while still swapping to show the most relevant page in their search results . typical use cases included dividing content into multiple parts and creating multiple pages for product lists , forum threads , and lists of blogs .   let ’s take a look at what the actual code might look like for a three - page series .   page one :   this is the first page , so it only needs to reference the next page .   < link rel=\"next \" href=\"https://website.com / page/2 \" / >   page two :   this references both the next and previous pages in the series .   < link rel=\"next \" href=\"https://website.com / page/3 \" / > < link rel=\"prev \" href=\"https://website.com / page/1 \" / >   page three :   this is the last page , so it only needs to reference the previous page .   < link rel=\"prev \" href=\"https://website.com / page/2 \" / >   however , in 2019 , google decided to tell us they no longer used rel = prev / next for pagination . even worse , they apparently had n’t used it for years .   spring cleaning ! as we evaluated our indexing signals , we decided to retire rel = prev / next .   studies show that users love single - page content , aim for that when possible , but multi - part is also fine for google search . know and do what ’s best for * your * users ! # springiscoming pic.twitter.com/hcodpokgkp — google webmasters ( @googlewmc ) march 21 , 2019   this change really did n’t impact seo . for duplicate content , having some blocks of text the same is n’t going to hurt your site and there ’s no penalty . google will still try to find the best version of that content to show .   so the question is , why the change ? and what should you do about it , if anything ?   in this post , you ’ll learn :   let ’s start at the top .   why did google remove support for rel = prev / next ?   before google dropped the bombshell that they no longer use rel = prev / next , one of the official recommendations for pagination was to do nothing and let them figure it out .   do nothing . paginated content is very common , and google does a good job returning the most relevant results to users , regardless of whether content is divided into multiple pages .   knowing this , the most likely reason they stopped using rel = prev / next is that they just got better at figuring it out and felt they no longer needed the additional hints .   google has several options besides rel = prev / next that they can use to identify the pages in a series . for the most part , websites are consistent with their implementations of paginated pages , and google can look at things like :   headings   page titles ( same title or with a page number added )   links on the page ( internal links to other pages in the set )   it ’s also possible that the recommendations for pagination were leading to poor user experiences as sites split their content across multiple pages . most of the time , this was done for page views and advertising revenue , but the experience was annoying to users and made it difficult for people to find what they were looking for . here are two examples of what i mean .   how could seos have known rel = prev / next did n’t work ?   when google announced they had n’t supported rel = prev / next in years , one of the first questions i got from a lot of seos was how could we as technical seos not have known this ?   the simple answer is there was n’t a way to tell . if google had not told us , we would n’t know .   if the pagination were working , then google would consolidate signals for the set of pages . while they would commonly show the first page in the set , they would also swap which page was shown if there was a more relevant page from the set in the search results . if the pagination was n’t working , well , the same would happen because that ’s how search works — google returns the most relevant page for the query .   should seos remove rel = prev / next ?   no .   if you ’ve already implemented rel = prev / next on your website , do not remove it . google was not the only source to use this information . it is still recommended by w3c and used for web accessibility and ada compliance . some browsers also use it for prefetching . also , other search engines like bing still use the markup .   we ’re using rel prev / next ( like most markup ) as hints for page discovery and site structure understanding . at this point we ’re not merging pages together in the index based on these and we ’re not using prev / next in the ranking model . https://t.co/zwbszkn3jf — frédéric dubut ( @copernix ) march 21 , 2019   acceptable pagination implementations   most setups that use rel = prev / next also use self - referencing canonical tags . for this setup , do n’t change anything at all . treat the pages as you would any other indexable page on your site and make sure to internally link to other pages in the pagination set .   you can also canonicalize paginated pages so that they point to a view - all page that displays all the content . in this way , the content can still be broken up into pages for users , but the indexed version is going to contain all of the content .   how people are hurting their sites   this is how a typical setup looks where each page is crawled and discovered :   but there are a few common mistakes people make when handling pagination that hurt their site . these are :   canonicalizing to the first page   noindexing pages   nofollowing links   blocking crawling   let ’s take a closer look at each of these issues , and how to check for them on your site .   mistake 1 : canonicalizing to the first page   the best - case scenario here is that google ignores the canonical tag . if the canonical tags are respected , you ’ll end up cutting off crawl paths to many pages and orphaning the content . this makes it harder for search engines to find and index valuable content , and also cuts off the flow of pagerank throughout your site .   how to check for this mistake on your website   crawl your site in ahrefs ’ site audit , then go to the page explorer and apply this set of filters :   if there are any matching urls , take a look at the canonical url . pages in the pagination series that canonicalize to the first page should be changed .   mistake 2 : noindexing pages   adding noindex to pages is going to remove pages from the index . those pages are no longer eligible to rank and pagerank wo n’t be passed .   while the links on the page may initially be crawled , that may change over time . google webmaster trends analyst john mueller has mentioned that noindex pages will be treated as nofollow at some point , but it ’s unknown how long that takes . when another webmaster trends analyst gary illyes was asked about this , he seemed to think they would still be crawled . without knowing fully how this works , it ’s best to err on the side of caution and not noindex these pages unless you have an alternate crawl path .     how to check for this mistake on your website   crawl your site in ahrefs ’ site audit , then go to the page explorer and apply this set of filters :   if there are any matching urls , remove the noindex directive from the robots meta tag or x - robots - tag http header on the page or url .   mistake 3 : nofollowing links   internal links to other paginated pages should never be marked nofollow . nofollow is now a hint for google , and your best case is that they ignore what you mark nofollow . what happens is you could cut off crawling and passing of signals like pagerank through your site and again can orphan pages .   how to check for this mistake on your website   crawl your site in ahrefs ’ site audit , then go to the page explorer and apply this set of filters :   if there are any matching urls , click on the number in the “ no . of inlinks nofollow ” column .   this will bring up an overlay showing where to find those nofollowed links on your site .   remove the nofollow attributes from those specific links , or remove the nofollow directive from the robots meta tag or x - robots - tag http header on the page or url .   mistake 4 : blocking from crawling   blocking the pages from crawling will again make it more difficult to find content on the website , end up orphaning pages , and also cut off the flow of pagerank through your site .   how to check for this mistake on your website   check your robots.txt file for directives blocking search engines from crawling paginated pages . here ’s what that might look like :   user - agent : * disallow : /blog / page/   remove these directives from your robots.txt file .   final thoughts   if you already had rel = prev / next implemented for pagination , leave it alone . there ’s no reason to change it , and you ’re likely to do more harm than good .   if you want to change pagination because you believe these paginated pages are low quality or they do n’t provide much value , then consider grouping the pages in a way that ’s useful to users and also provides an alternate crawl path for search engines . for example , if you wanted to use categories to group a bunch of blog posts , then that ’s probably more useful to users than a bunch of paginated pages containing posts about many topics . these category pages containing posts about one topic have a chance of showing up in the serps for relevant terms about the category .   if you ’re going to use categories as the crawl and navigation path , you also need to make sure your categories are linked from your homepage . that may require a website redesign , so it ’s not something i ’d recommend unless you ’re going to be changing your site design anyway . even with this method , you may still end up using some form of pagination for the categories if you have a lot of posts in each one , so it also adds complexity to the setup .   if you have n’t implemented rel = prev / next yet and are wondering if you should , then that ’s a tough call . i would say it mostly depends on the effort required to add it now vs. the impact . remember that this markup is still used by other search engines , some browsers , and for accessibility , so it may still be worth the effort .   just in case anyone needs a link to the original documentation that was deleted , here you go .   have questions about rel = prev / next or pagination ? message me on twitter .',\n",

  or you ’ve already launched an abm campaign and you want to take it to the next level ?   in either case , we ’ve got you covered . as the new year rolls into full swing , we want to make sure you ’re equipped with the best information .   a number of industry sources have expressed their belief that account - based marketing will continue to grow in popularity . it ’s also worth remembering that abm is a relatively new b2b model , in the sense that it ’s yet to fully enter the mainstream .   do you need account - based marketing ?   new tools , like our own free tracking platform , are quickly beginning to enter the marketplace . and a host of resources , from blogs to books to podcasts , are becoming available .   this is good news for you . there ’s still time to get ahead of the curve , gaining that vital edge on your competition , while also taking advantage of all the online tools and information at your disposal .   in this roundup of the seven best abm books , we ’ve taken as wide a view possible . alongside books that are specifically about abm , we ’ve also covered the topics of customer profiling , analytics , outreach and even automation .   1 . account - based marketing for dummies by sangram vajre   if you ’re just getting started , then this is the book we recommend you sit down with . it gives a solid overview of how to structure an account - based marketing campaign , from identifying accounts , to profiling , reaching out to targets and measuring your results .   we really liked the fact that there ’s an emphasis on using data to drive decisions at all stages of the process . there ’s also advice about picking the best online tools for streamlining and automating your efforts .   the author , sangram vajre , is one of the co - founders of terminus , a leading abm software provider , so he ’s talking directly from experience .   2 . a practitioner ’s guide to account - based marketing by bev burgess   a practitioner ’s guide to account - based marketing is similar in scope and structure to account - based marketing for dummies . it makes a nice companion book ( it can be useful to get a slightly different take on the same ideas ) and also offers information in some distinct areas .   there are lots of practical examples from big companies like fujitsu and microsoft . time is also spent on advising marketers how they can develop a career in abm . the authors are very explicit in their belief that abm is going to shake up the marketing world and draw on a number of examples to support their points .   3 . predictable prospecting by marylou taylor and jeremey donovan   predictable prospecting is a book about account - based marketing with a focus on identifying and profiling key accounts . it gives a full overview of the abm process ( even if it ’s not as detailed as the two preceding books ) but really shines when it comes to the prospecting phase .   we were impressed by the practical implementations of the book and the use of step - by - step instructions and specific examples . if you find your campaigns faltering at this stage , or you want to make sure your approach is watertight , then this is the book to read . the other added benefit is that it ’s not too long !   4 . successful key account management by grant stewart   what happens once you ’ve netted those all - important accounts ? “ key account management ” is one of those widely - used but often misunderstood terms . account management is a crucial part of the abm process but it ’s also one that is overlooked by many marketers . the results are missed opportunities for growth , referrals and continued revenue . we really like the structure and scope of successful key account management by grant stewart . the information is laid out as a week - long course , it ’s easy to digest , and it fits in nicely with the other aspects of any abm campaign . it covers everything from effectively profiling your current accounts , to pinpointing revenue opportunities and explains the difference between negotiating with existing vs. new customers .   key marketing metrics is a mammoth of a book and it would be counterproductive to try and read it all . it is immensely useful , however , as a reference book for putting together your own marketing metric mix and delving deeper into some of the most important kpis .   without a clear understanding of what you ’re tracking , it ’s impossible to gauge the effectiveness of your abm campaigns . online tools make it easier than ever to track results at every stage of the process , but it ’s vital that you know which metrics to pay attention to and understand them properly . this book has all the information that you could ever need .   the stage at which you open a dialogue with a potential account is one of the most crucial . a successful conversation with a prospect , whether it ’s through email , on the phone or in person , can be the difference between netting a high - value account or losing it .   the book crucial conversations contains a number of insights you can bring to your outreach campaigns and sales conversations . we think it should be required reading for every marketer and salesperson . you ’ll be surprised at how much it challenges your current approach to pursuing big accounts .   7 . think outside the inbox by david cummings and adam blitzer   at albacross , part of our unique proposition is that we can automate many laborious parts of the abm process . this lets marketers better use their resources to hone in on the really important , human - powered parts of their campaign . we believe that automation is going to be one of the biggest disruptors of the marketing space in the years to come , and it ’s already very much under way .   as an abmer it ’s vital that you understand when and how to automate key parts of your process . the authors are the founders of pardot , one of the biggest marketing automation software companies in the world , and in their book they pay specific attention to email campaigns and analytics tracking .   it ’s a great introduction to automation and ties in very nicely with other aspects of account - based marketing .   the challenger customer is based on an interesting premise , one that should be of unique interest to account - based marketers . it focuses on what ’s involved in persuading companies to open new accounts when multiple people are involved in the decision - making process .   the central argument is that within many companies , a relatively small number of people hold the purchase - making power . and that your strategies and approaches can be tailored to identify and talk to these people directly .   learn more on the topic   now it ’s time to get reading !   if there ’s one thing we ’ve learned at albacross , it ’s that no two companies are the same . we always strive to meet customers where they are and gain an understanding of their unique needs and goals .   in putting together this list , our hope is that we ’ve been able to provide you with the resources you need to improve your campaign . for some that may mean delving deep into analytics , for others it will involve improving profiling processes .   in either case , it ’s time to get reading ! or you could just download blinkist …',\n",

'   is also one of the important vibes a great package is broadcasting . we are living in a world of big numbers where a person might feel as a tiny part of a business machine , which can be disturbing . getting rid of this feelings makes your customer happier . here 's a quote from a redditor sharing his great unboxing experience : ' like damn . it felt so personal and extraordinary . ' this is , probably , one of the most material things you can actually measure : people will share their experience . they will write reviews , post instagram and facebook pictures and even shoot videos , which gives you additional coverage .   unboxing videos trend   a survey done by google shows that one in every five consumers has watched an unboxing video . and 62 % of those people watched it because they were researching that product .   here ’s how the interest in unboxing videos has grown over time :   people are shooting thousands of videos on unboxing literally everything :   but can this help your business ? sure it can .   1 . people are going to share their unboxing experience with your brand .   2 . people read and watch unboxing articles and videos while researching products .   3 . you can boost your coverage by making the first step and connecting with bloggers and journalists .   building great unboxing experience   structure of unboxing experience   first of all , it really depends on what you sell , your own products / brand or resell items from several brands . the second case can be more complicated , as you probably will need to ship the items in the package they came to you in . however , if you are serious about improving you customer experience , there 's always a way out .   these are the components of unboxing experience according to out physiology :   how you feel it ( emotions )   how you touch it   how it smells   how it looks   we 're missing the sound here , but for now it will be too much , right ?   building blocks of unboxing experience   the list is long so you can pick a couple of factors from it - of course , using them all can be excessive .   box   laying out   it 's important how you place products inside the package . ideally they should n't be in a mess . think of shop windows and how they arrange products in baskets and boxes .   card   no need to say a personal card wins the day . everyone loves to feel special !   here 's some feedback from a real merchant on this approach :   tissue paper   lots of opportunities here . you could use single color paper to match the box , or the ribbon , or make use of numerous variants paper manufacturers offer . here 's a box from julep ; they used a nice tissue with glitter :   fillers   usual box fillers are foam items , air pillows , bubble wrap , or cut paper . if your items are fragile , paper wo n't help , but you can use color bubble paper instead !   stickers / ribbons   these items are used to hold the tissue paper . they are extremely cheap but make your parcel look like a true present .   business card   promo ( coupons , discounts , loyalty program invitations )     receipt   think great eating places - an envelope or a receipt holder is a tradition . louis vuitton receipt envelopes are very simple , but make a good impression . they also are usually printed on quality yellow branded paper :   tape   if you 're using box tape , look at color or branded variants , their price is almost the same as for clear tape , and your carton box will look much better .   gift   adding small gifts to bigger orders is a known practice , and you should definitely try it .   samples   many companies are doing this , and you should do too if you sell items that have samples . moreover , very often it does n't cost anything for you because suppliers often ship free samples so merchants could distribute them to raise interest in new products . only make sure that the samples are at least close to the interests of your customer , it means that you need to have a look what the shopper has ordered , what 's his age and gender .   envelope   envelopers are cheap and can be used to store any paper sheets with information . it is wise to provide a branded envelope for items that are supposed to be stored , like warranties or receipts .   something to extend unboxing experience   this could be a piece of paper inviting to visit an url or your social media accounts , download an app with the help of a qr code , or invitation to leave a review , or to participate in loyalty program . in other words , something that offers to connect with your brand once more . wantable asks for feedback with a card :   bag   scent   some products may have an unpleasant scent ( for example , new shoes or clothes smell badly if they were packed right after they were produced ) . to reduce that or just to make your customer smile , put something with a nice scent into the box . it could be petals , some dry lavender , a tiny soap bar , or you could just drop a couple of scented water onto the box or the paper tissue . make sure the smell wo n't spoil the product itself - it is not advisable to use perfume for food or children items .   catalog   treats   candy ? yes please . treats upset only those who are on a diet .   product safety     remember that unboxing experience is important , and product safety is crucial . air bags are not the cutest filler , but they will keep a perfume bottle safe . a customer wo n't be happy with a broken bottle and a dozen of samples inside the package .   easiness of unboxing   make sure it 's easy to unpack the items . remember that your customers should n't apply the hulk power to open the box or the plastic package and actually get the product . because these things go viral :   return label , warranties     description card   it 's nice if there 's a possibility to include a card with the product description if it 's your own brand and no instructions come with the items . see how beautybox includes cards with descriptions on their products in each box :   other details   i often buy shirts , and in most of the cases they have lots of tiny sharp pins to hold everything in place . once i received a shirt with small plastic clips instead . what a relief when you know you would n't hurt yourself unboxing the item !   pricing   it 's hard to give any advice on how to leverage the product price and package expenses , as this is always the matter of a particular case .   but there 's one thing you should think about : your great package does n't have to be expensive . there are lots of companies that offer package materials , and it 's always cheaper in bulk .   typical mistakes of packaging in terms of unboxing experience   overpackaging   more is less . according to sealed air e - commerce survey , extra packaging can be annoying and may force people to think they paid too much :   in other words , the package should be enough to keep the product safe and to call for positive emotions . overdecorating or using too many materials can scare your customers off .   ordered new shoelaces from @colehaan , and this is what they shipped them in . overpackage much ? # ecofail pic.twitter.com/ebh46wgv — jim prosser ( @jimprosser ) february 14 , 2013   providing nice package for a segment of customers   if you decided to provide custom package for your customers , make sure all of your clients will be able to have this unboxing experience . in other case , those who received a plain package are likely to be offended if they find out someone got a better ' present ' . we are all children somewhere deep inside .   providing package perks just to check the box   here 's the case from my own unboxing experience ; i ordered a line of cosmetics marked 25 + ( a moisturizer , a face wash and a toner ) , and the box was generously filled with anti - wrinkle product testers marked 45 + . seriously ? just wrapping products in tissues and throwing in some unnecessary items or testers is n't going to work .   not matching the size of the package and the item   irony is the least you can actually receive by putting a small item into a huge box . also , the product can be damaged , or delivery will cost more .   biggest package fail yet . what am i supposed to do with all this cardboard @amazonuk ? ! # hugeboxwithhardlyanythingin pic.twitter.com/nzm0z5mbr5 — jack morris ( @jaydeemorris ) september 11 , 2013   unboxing experience trends   ' green packaging '   offering green package is not only a way to tell that your brand actually cares . it 's only an opportunity for the customer to feel connected with the idea of ecology . what 's more , ' green ' material tend to look stylish , representing the ' natural ' trend . more and more companies offer their services on creating sustainable package .   green package usually is made of recycled materials , that also can be recycled or do n't damage the environment . dell is using bamboo packaging and explains why :   reusable packaging   in fact , i 'm using these puma little clever bags myself - and it was a great experience unboxing their shoes . puma combined green and reusable packaging and made it a signature of their brand . they reduced the amount of material spent on the box and packed it in a bag that can be reused - or simply used for shoes storage .   as some other companies , puma gives advice and instructions on how you can reuse their packaging .   final steps   now when you feel like jumping in , what to do ? create a test shipping box , design it with care and combine elements with a bit of style . and test it on your nearest and dearest - will they be happy to receive it ?   giving the word to you ! have you been experiencing anything great with receiving goods from online shops ?

              " 'topic clusters wo n’t save you : how to focus & prioritize . search engines have evolved beyond optimizing for keywords . the more effective approach is to optimize for topics .   we ’re told to take our list of keywords , identify core topics for pillar pages , build related content associated with the core topic in the form of spoke pages , and then internally link them together .   one of the major hurdles we kept banging our head against the wall with is how to cluster keywords together accurately at scale .   there are some tools that are able to cluster keywords together , but n one of them could tell us :   what should we do first ?   what is the best way to plan all of this out ?   where topic clusters fit in content strategy   planning a content editorial calendar from a huge list of unorganized keywords is a mess . grouping them into clusters makes things easier . it lets you segment based on relevance , search intent , the customer ’s journey , etc .   grouping them manually is tedious and prone to errors . it can take months depending on the size of the data set .   while there are several tools available that help with this process , we had to develop our own because none of the public options were actionable enough .   we needed more than a set of clustered keywords . we needed direction . we needed to know which topics to create first , how to optimally link them together , and how to build authority in a brand new topic by leveraging the topical authority we already had .   our internal topic cluster & graph tool   keyword clustering alone is n’t good enough   topic clustering , keyword clustering , keyword grouping , ( or whatever you want to call it ) is not a silver bullet . it ’s a single step in the keyword research process on our quest to find the best content topics for organic search .   the best topics for organic search are those that are the easiest to make , rank , distribute , and promote with the highest conversion value to traffic potential ratio   let ’s say you ’ve used a tool to help cluster your keywords together . you now have a good idea of what topics to cover in each piece .   great .   now what ?   what do you with it ? how do you build a strategy from here ?   you could use them to throw together an editorial calendar for the quarter , but that ’s not a strategy . that ’s just guessing .   this approach is only a slight improvement from what you were doing before . you went from relying on your gut to group topics together to relying on your gut to prioritize them .   note : this assumes the keyword data you fed a program to cluster your topics is comprehensive . if it ’s not , your clusters will miss out on opportunities and intents .     most topic clustering tools have input limits on how many keywords you can run at once , ranging from 1000 to 25,000 . when we build our clusters , we do n’t want limits . we wanted a way to process any number of keywords we threw at it — whether that was 250,000 or 2.5 million .   so how do we build a strategy from this ?   everything is a subset of business strategy   you need to think about how to map your clusters to align with the overarching strategy of the business . in jimmy daly ’s superpath community he talks about how content is a subset of business strategy . topic clusters are a subset of content strategy .   everything is a subset of business strategy   if you align your clusters with the big - picture , you can plan a content calendar that focuses on value .   there ’s no perfect way to determine how valuable a topic will be . but we can minimize our opportunity cost with more data .   note : how a business determines value will vary . it ’s not always related to organic search . the focus may be on things like customer retention or competitive positioning . in the context of keyword clusters though , the focus is on value from organic traffic .   for us , the best approach we ’ve found includes accounting for things like :   search intent   traffic potential   topic difficulty   content difficulty   shareability   linkability   combining this data , we ’re able to derive what we call priority score .   is it perfect ? no . but it is better than topic clusters alone . with this data , we can supply our monte carlo simulation with the inputs it needs to project the roi on our content marketing efforts .   prioritizing content topics with data   there are no universal rules to calculate and weigh each of the following variables . we aggregate the data to build our priority score . then we treat it as a science . we experiment , test , observe , and iterate .   you ’re encouraged to do so as well .   try to get them as dialed in as you can but forget about perfection . directional accuracy is more important — and more pragmatic .   remember , the goal is to take your clusters and organize them to focus on the best topics : those that are the easiest to make , rank , distribute , and promote with the highest conversion value to traffic potential ratio .   search intent & the funnel   determine search intent to know which topic clusters make sense for your business . sensible topics are those that align search intent with business goals .   if you get search intent wrong , you ’re going to have a difficult time ranking for that topic .   period .   you can always revisit a page that misses intent and update it , but getting it right the first time is better .   at a high level , you can segment search intent into four primary categories :   informational navigational investigational transactional   once you ’ve set the intent for each topic cluster , you can then map each of these to your marketing funnel .   in doing so , you ’ll be able to add your average conversion rate by funnel stage . if you do n’t know what this is , you can set it at 2 % to establish a baseline .   mapping your clusters to the funnel also makes it easier to plan other marketing tactics to pair with each piece of content later .   this can be a time - consuming process , but it ’s too important to ignore . other tools could n’t handle doing this at scale , so we developed a way to do it in our own algorithm .   calculating search intent from serps in golang   tips for the tactician : you ’ll have to do this manually if your tool does n’t calculate search intent . you can speed things up using query statements in things like google sheets . if you ’re working with a large data set , you can use a connected sheet with bigquery .   traffic potential trumps search volume   sorting your keyword clusters by volume is a quick way to determine priority .   it ’s also misleading .   search volume is not indicative of business value . it ’s better to calculate the relative traffic potential for the keyword cluster .   start with search volume , then factor in clickstream data for things like :   clicks per search ( cps )   click distribution   return rate ( rr ) is an interesting one too   tools like ahrefs and semrush provide a cps value that can export and map to your cluster data .   note : semrush calls this click potential . their formula assumes you ’re ranking in the first organic position . ahrefs calls this cps and does not have it for every keyword .   we take the estimated search volume for the cluster and multiply it by a set of ctr values we have in a lookup table .   you ’ll want to account for the range of potential ranking positions , intent , the industry you ’re in , and the presence of serp features when calculating this . these all impact the click - through rate organic results receive .   searches with commercial intent get more clicks than those with informational intent   branded searches beat non - branded   long - tail ctr is higher than short - tail   featured snippets + people also ask boxes reduce ctr   ctr curve for organic results   for content refreshes : prevailing wisdom says you should look for keywords ranking on the second page and work to get them to the first page . that ’s not always optimal . if you ’re ranking on the first page for a target keyword , your primary focus should be getting it to the top . the ctr delta between ranks 12 and 8 is barely over a 10th of a percentage point ( 0.11%+ ) . contrast that with going from rank 4 to rank 3 ( doubling ctr from 4.21 % to 8.13 % ) or from rank 4 to the first position ( 7x increase to a 30 % ctr ) . for a single keyword with an estimated 1000 monthly search volume that ’s the difference between 42 clicks ( ranking fourth ) and 301 ( ranking first ) . this is assuming every search performed gets at least one click — which is n’t the case .   if your method of keyword clustering does not pull in serp feature data , you can get it from the most popular tools ( e.g. semrush , ahrefs ) . be aware that ahrefs does not provide information on whether or not a local pack gets triggered .   tips for the tactician : you can build a set of standard ctr values for different scenarios using up - to - date data from advancedwebranking to create a lookup table that takes position , features , and industry into account .   topic difficulty   topic difficulty is n’t the same as keyword difficulty .   with topic difficulty , you ’re evaluating the serp from a brand perspective .   you can add weighting to topic difficulty by comparing yourself to other brands on the first page . we do n’t base this off of dr or anything like that . we research and find the big brands that have name recognition ( called icons internally ) . then we add them as a parameter to our algorithm to account for them as it runs .   that does n’t mean smaller brands ca n’t tackle a topic where big brands dominate the serps . it ’s something to consider when calculating a priority score though . if we see a few smaller brands ranking on the first page , that makes that topic more viable .   lower authority site outranking healthline   tips for the tactician : we calculate our score for each serp based on the count of big brands and their ranking position . we then take the average score across all keyword variants in the cluster weighted by the traffic potential for that keyword . to find big brands , note domains appear a lot across your topics then get the search volume for their brand name . those with the highest branded search volume are the ones to be aware of when calculating relative topic difficulty . do n’t ignore the fact that some brand names may have search intent that is n’t always branded either .   content difficulty   creating good content is hard .   some content is more difficult to create than others — and not just as a function of word count .   we calculate content difficulty by considering the actual resources and effort it will take to make the right type of content that aligns with the searcher ’s intent .   this is n’t always written content .   figure out if you ’ll need video , custom imagery / diagrams , tools , calculators , tables , or other types of media .   the difficulty for each content type will vary based on the topic and the business it ’s for . you can use a relative metric like 0 - 10 to weight content difficulty . consider available resources for content marketing projects to add weight to that scale .   more difficult content takes longer to put together but has a higher roi when you get it right . it ’s difficult for the competition to copy and also tends to attract links / shares .   take this example by wistia that provides free expert training to teach you what you need to know to create a compelling video series or podcast for your brand . expensive to build this content to put together but will drive a ton of leads .   show business series by wistia   other important factors : shareability & linkability   do n’t neglect to consider how you ’re going to distribute and promote your content before you make it .   there will be topics with poor scores in all other metrics that are perfect for engagement on channels other than search .   distribution & shareability   note : brands lacking in topical authority and name recognition should weigh this score higher . a few good pieces that get traction can make a significant difference to your bottom line .   do we want evergreen content that can rake in passive traffic and revenue over time ?   yes .   smaller brands have a lot to gain by building trust with an audience first though . the impact this will have on your total organic search performance is indirect but important .   advice on scoring : do n’t rely on aggregate metrics from tools like ahrefs ’ content explorer , buzzsumo , etc . to find what type of content gets shared . these tools favor popular sites and do n’t reveal the delta between normal and outstanding performance .   instead , use that data to compare how it does to the average for that site during the past year divided into quartiles .   derek gleason does a great job breaking down how to do this in a course on cxl and in this youtube video .   derek gleason ’s course on cxl   promotion & linkability   here ’s an a priori truth :   the best way to get links is to create content that people like linking to .   when determining priority , ask yourself , “ how difficult will it be to get people to link to this piece ? ”   again , weighting this score is relative to your business . a company with an in - house link building or pr team will be able to handle this better than one that does n’t .   note : do n’t underestimate the difference a highly linkable asset can add to your evergreen content either . a single highly - linked post can lift the rankings of your entire site .   starting with this sort of piece can be a gamble but it pays off big — especially if it can generate links passively over time .   well - known brands with a ton of brand or topic authority can weigh this factor lower . they often receive links on autopilot from their already established audience .   things can be more difficult to calculate for small brands .   for each cluster , we take into account things like :   how many links are needed   from what types of sites   from what types of content   at what velocity   the true cost per link   we get this data by reverse - engineering top competitors ranking for our target topics .   this process is very labor - intensive so we built a program for that too .   our link intelligence report   further reading : how we conduct a competitive backlink analysis .   after action report : strategy ≠ execution   topic clusters by themselves are n’t very useful . by combining data to understand the intent , traffic potential , difficulty , complexity , shareability , and linkability — you can make confident decisions when planning where to focus your efforts .   having a plan is great on paper but useless if not implemented . knowing what to do and how to prioritize everything is not enough for success either . you can use our recommendations as a framework to create a revenue -

of - funnel topics — the broad , awareness - building kind that focuses on educating people instead of pitching them .   content planned in your editorial calendar does n’t always have to tie back to revenue in a direct line . this is n’t the same as saying that content should n’t aid revenue growth — but it wo n’t always be straightforward .   we create content to relieve constraints on growth . doing this means you have to identify those constraints first .   constraints to consider :   a need for brand awareness / discovery → tofu   if you have plenty of awareness but a hard time converting , then tofu content makes the problem worse .   building trust & brand awareness   top - of - funnel content is best when you need to :   establish trust with an audience who does n’t know who you are and ;   grow your brand awareness .   this applies to brands with :   much lower branded search traffic relative to their competitors   relative to their competitors much lower direct traffic to their sites relative to their competitors   semrush : asana vs scoro   60 % of asana ’s organic traffic is from branded searches ( an estimated 1.3 million traffic / month ) . scoro only gets about 9 % ( ≈ 8,000 / month ) of its organic traffic from branded searches .   similar web : asana vs scoro direct traffic comparison   nearly 84 % of asana ’s traffic comes from direct channels compared to scoro ’s 47 % .   we could say that we ’d expect this from asana . they ’re a project management tool that users visit every day . that same logic applies to scoro as well though   fighting to be considered   top - of - funnel content gives you a chance to convince people that you can solve their problem .   if you immediately begin pushing the sale you ’re doing yourself a disservice . people like you more if you help them . help them now so they consider you later when they ’re looking to buy .   and that ’s the primary goal : to be in the consideration set .   that consideration set is small . not because buyers whittle it down to the best , but because humans excel at screening things out .   consider how advertising works for a moment . advertising works by being recallable to people exposed to it . through exposure , brands gradually build up memory structures in the minds of consumers . this keeps them in the running for that consideration set .   this same concept from advertising applies to organic search . every visit from organic search is like one more ad impression . one that ’s a lot more powerful than the glimpse that flies by as someone scrolls through their feed .   even when the person does n’t take action — it still has value .   developing mindshare   winning on search is a zero - sum game . the more serp real estate you own in your industry , the more you win .   top - of - funnel topics are the best way to capture large shares of the available organic search traffic with a single piece of content . they often encompass hundreds to thousands of related search terms .   your brand gets seen over and over again whenever people search for something related to your industry .   guru claiming a ton of real estate for knowledge management terms   first movers advantage   look for trends gaining momentum in your industry . you can use top - of - funnel content to get there before it gets too competitive . doing so while it ’s easy will net big returns in the long run .   the earlier you get there the harder it is for other brands to unseat you — even the bigger brands .   in august of 2017 searches related to keto began to trend up .   trends for keto on the rise in august 2017   healthline anticipated this and rode the wave — attracting a lot of free traffic along the way .   healthline publishes keto 101 page in the fall of 2017   the key is to spot opportunities early and get entrenched quickly .   building authority   there are two primary ways to develop authority in the world of seo .   getting links from other authoritative websites and ; contributing enough content to the corpus of industry knowledge that you build a name for yourself .   link building   backlinks are important for building authority . i think we can all collectively agree on that .   it ’s also not easy .   especially highly competitive industries like saas , finance , insurance , and health . if all you have on your website is bottom - of - funnel content , you ’ll have a hard time getting links .   people prefer to link to content that ’s interesting and helpful to their audience — not content that ’s too promotional . review some of the top saas companies in ahrefs and you ’ll find top - of - funnel content usually generate the most links .   related sources :   3 out of the top 7 most linked - to pages on hubspot ’s website are informational / education ( tofu ) content .   hubspot ’s most linked to pages   we see the same thing with canva . 6/8 pages with the most backlinks are top - of - funnel content .   canva ’s most linked to pages   thought leadership   being a thought leader and creating content is a damn good way to get people to share and link to your content . the more people it reaches the more likely you ’ll be able to influence the narrative in your industry .   producing good thought leadership content that will pick up traction is n’t easy — but it pays off in the long run when you ’re competitors and customers begin adopting your philosophies .   katie parrott , from animalz , describes this as the relationship you want your company to have with your space . how your customers , competitors , and your whole industry see your brand .   look at hubspot . they ’ve produced a ton of thought leadership over the years , shaping how we talk about marketing . we all use phrases like inbound marketing , hub and spoke , and topic clusters now — all because hubspot created content that sought to influence and educate the industry as a whole .   far left of graph is still nearly 70k / m in organic traffic   i filtered hubspot ’s top pages report to include questions that were n’t related to the brand name . some of these pages get more organic traffic than the entire website of some saas companies .   hubspot ’s top pages report ( filtered )   at nearly $ 600 / share and well over 18 million monthly organic visitors , hubspot ’s approach to content is working .   hubspot market summary   if you ’re still not convinced , ask yourself : how would it feel if my customers and even my competitors began adopting my language and ideas ?   the long game   tackling top - of - funnel content is for the patient - minded who want to win the long game . it is not an overnight sprint to success but a slow and methodical climb to the top .   you have to think of top - of - funnel content as a loss leader . if you ’re asking about conversions from top - of - funnel content , you ’re asking the wrong question .   try this : what ’s the first brand that comes to mind when you think about integrating two applications together ?   was it zapier ?   zapier dominates app integration & automation   top - of - funnel content is how you build up momentum within a market and become the brand that comes to mind when people think about your industry .   the links that top - of - funnel content help attract will also make it easier to rank for the more conversion - focused phrases that fall lower in the funnel as well .   that equity gets passed around throughout your site via internal links , helping seo - driven content deliver compounding results over time .   when tofu is n’t the right thing to do   there are times when you should n’t focus on top - of - funnel content . if you ’ve built up a large amount of tofu traffic but struggle converting visitors into customers , more top - of - funnel content wo n’t help . it ’ll make the problem worse .   when tofu & bofu apply   example : asana & scoro   consider a company like asana . asana leads the pack in the g2 grid for project management software . they also get an estimated 2.1 million visitors from organic traffic per month ( 79 % branded ) . they have a free plan for up to 15 users , something we all know helps increase sign - ups and to grow faster .   asana ’s pricing plan   i do n’t know how well asana is converting free customers to paid , but i guarantee increasing that number is high on their priority list .   they do n’t need more top - of - funnel content to do this . they need middle - of - funnel and bottom - of - funnel content that will convince free customers to upgrade .   if we contrast that with a tool like scoro , we see a different story .   google trends shows scoro does n’t even average above 1 % of total interest over the past five years compared to asana , trello , clickup , and wrike .   these tools all have a free version except for scoro .   and that ’s fine .   scoro has the most robust feature set ( that ’s also relatively bug - free … looking at you clickup 👀 ) amongst the pack . it would n’t make sense from a business perspective for scoro to offer a free plan . it also does n’t mean scoro would benefit from more top - of - funnel traffic .   scoro only gets about .003 % of the branded search traffic that asana gets and less than .0008 % of the aggregate branded search traffic across the other five tools .   search volume of 5 project management saas companies   however , scoro has a lot of great content across the whole funnel . they rank well for tofu queries like :   project management tools   invoicing software   crm tools   business budgeting software   time management tools   scoro ’s tofu organic rankings   while they could benefit from more top - of - funnel traffic , it ’s unlikely to be a primary constraint on growth .   scoro wants to attract a much more sophisticated audience . scoro has the ability to handle quotes , invoicing , project management , utilization , and robust reporting . all things that asana tries to do , albeit more ornamental than anything .   scoro ’s reports dashboard   asana ’s reporting dashboard   what scoro likely needs , if anything , is more advertising to increase their brand awareness or more flexible pricing plans .   for example , a scaled - down version of their ultimate tier with all the same features but a lower minimum user requirement ( the current requirement is a minimum of 5 ) . more accessible for smaller teams to jump in and experience what they ’ve been missing would be a quick way to get people spreading the word . video testimonial content anyone ? ✋   it ’s not a question of if every brand needs top , middle , or bottom - of - funnel content — it ’s a question of when and how much . it ’s a matter of timing , current constraints , and the marketing trajectory of the business .   remember , you ’re not a day trader   top - of - funnel content unlocks constraints preventing companies from achieving compounding growth from organic search . it is not something you can do overnight .   the biggest , most lucrative keywords take a lot of high - quality content bolstered by a web of supporting content , and links .   quick wins are great , but they ’re momentary .   if you solely focus on quick wins , you ’ll miss out on far greater growth down the road . at some point , you have to tackle the bigger terms too if you want to stay competitive .   do n’t get distracted by the allure of quick money like a day trader while your competitors build a warren buffet - like momentum that you ca n’t catch up to .',\n",

              " 'link building case study : how i increased my search traffic by 110 % in 14 days . here ’s the brutal truth about link building :   there are way too many people in internet marketing today that think “ great content ” is enough .   they say , “ if i publish great stuff , people will naturally link to me ” .   if only it were that easy …   if you ’re serious about getting high quality links , you need to be very systematic with how you create and promote your content .   otherwise , you ’re taking the “ cooked spaghetti approach ” to seo : throwing a bunch of stuff against a wall and hoping something sticks .   well , today i ’m going to show you a technique that almost guarantees that you get high - quality links from every piece of content that you publish .   keep reading to learn how …   the skyscraper technique : ( content marketing for link builders )   on april 18th 2013 , i published google ’s 200 ranking factors : the complete list .   after executing “ the skyscraper technique “ , the number of backlinks to that page shot up like a rocket :   more importantly , organic search traffic to my entire site – not just that post – doubled in just 14 days :   as a nice bonus , that single post has driven more than 2 milion referral visitors to my site so far .   the best part ?   you can do the same thing for your site … even if you do n’t have a fortune 500 marketing budget or connections with influential bloggers .     the 3 - steps to using “ the skyscraper technique ” to get quality links and targeted traffic   there are 3 steps to the skyscraper technique .   and i go over all of them in this short - and - sweet video :   like i mentioned in the video above , here are the 3 - steps that make up the skyscraper technique :   step 1 : find link - worthy content   step 2 : make something even better   step 3 : reach out to the right people   here ’s why this technique works so well ( and what it has to do with a skyscraper ):   have you ever walked by a really tall building and said to yourself :   “ wow , that ’s amazing ! i wonder how big the 8th tallest building in the world is . ”   of course not .   it ’s human nature to be attracted to the best .   and what you ’re doing here is finding the tallest “ skyscraper ” in your space … and slapping 20 stories to the top of it .   all of a sudden you have the content that everyone wants to talk about ( and link to ) .   now : the skyscraper technique is just one of many strategies that i use to land first page google rankings . i reveal the others in my premium business training course , seo that works .   step # 1 : find proven linkable assets   a linkable asset is the foundation of any successful link - focused content marketing campaign ( including this one ) .   i ’m not sure who coined the phrase “ linkable asset ” , but it ’s the perfect description of what you want to create : a high - value page that you can leverage for links over and over again .   keep in mind that linkable asset is not “ 12 things spider man taught me about social media marketing ” link bait nonsense .   it ’s content so awesome , so incredible , and so useful that people ca n’t help but login to their wordpress dashboard and add a link to your site .   but how do you know if your linkable asset is going to be a huge success … or a total flop ?   that ’s easy : find content that ’s already generated a ton of links .   here ’s how :   now it ’s time for step 2 …   step # 2 : make something even better   your next step is to take what ’s out there and blow it out of the water .   here ’s how you can take existing content to the next level :   make it longer   in some cases , publishing an article that ’s simply longer or includes more items will do the trick .   if you find a link magnet with a title like “ 50 healthy snack ideas ” , publish a list of 150 ( or even 500 ) .   in my case , i decided to list all 200 ranking factors … or die trying .   the first 50 were a breeze . 50 - 100 were really hard . 100 - 150 were really , really hard . and 150 - 200 were damn near impossible .   it took 10 gallons of coffee and 20 hours of sitting in front of my laptop ( do n’t worry , i took bathroom breaks ) …   … but in the end , i had something that was clearly better than anything else out there .   more up - to - date   if you can take an out - of - date piece of content and spruce it up , you ’ve got yourself a winner .   for example , most of the other ranking factor lists were sorely outdated and lacked important ranking factors , like social signals :   if you find something with old information , create something that covers many of the same points … but update it with cutting - edge content .   better designed   sometimes , a visually stunning piece of content can generate a lot more links and social shares than something similar on an ugly page .   just check out help scout ’s customer acquisition strategies for entrepreneurs :   this guide is a curated list of links to other internet marketing sites .   and the page has generated a lot of buzz because it ’s beautifully designed .   for my guide , i added a nice banner at the top :   more thorough   most lists posts are just a bland list of bullet points without any meaty content that people can actually use .   but if you add a bit of depth for each item on your list , you have yourself a list post that ’s much more valuable .   in my case , i noticed that the other ranking factor lists lacked references and detail :   so i made sure each and every point on my list had a brief description ( with a reference ):   important note : i recommend that you beat the existing content on every level : length , design , current information etc .   this will make it objectively clear that you have the better piece of content .   this is really important when you start getting the word out …   step # 3 : reach out to the right people   email outreach is the linchpin of the skyscraper technique .   it ’s similar to straight - up link begging , but with a very important twist .   instead of emailing random people , you ’re reaching out to site owners that have already linked out to similar content .   when you qualify prospects like this , you know that :   1 . they run a site in your niche .   2 . they ’re interested in your topic .   3 . they ’ve already linked to an article on that topic .   now it ’s just a matter of giving them a friendly heads up about your clearly superior content .   here ’s how to do it :   1 . export all of the links pointing to your competitor ’s content into a spreadsheet .   2 . weed out referring pages that do n’t make sense to contact ( forums , article directories , etc . ) . in my case , after cleaning up the list , i had 160 very solid prospects to reach out to .   3 . i emailed all 160 of them using this template :   hey [ name ] , i was searching for some articles about [ your topic ] today and i came across this page : [ url ] i noticed that you linked to one of my favorite articles – [ article title ] just wanted to give you a heads up that i created a similar article . it ’s like [ name of the article ] , but more thorough and up to date : [ url ] might be worth a mention on your page . either way , keep up the awesome work ! cheers ,   [ your name ]   ( i obviously personalized and tweaked this template for everyone i reached out to . )   even i was shocked at the overwhelmingly positive response :   out of 160 emails i landed 17 links : an 11 % success rate .   considering that these were cold emails that asked for a link in the first email , an 11 % success rate is pretty amazing .   you may be thinking , “ 17 links , that ’s it ? ” .   but remember it ’s about quality , not quantity .   there were a lot of gems in that group of 17 links .   besides , just look at the meteoric rise in organic traffic that those 17 links got me ( in a very short time period , no less ) .   obviously , there were a few links to that page that came organically , but some of the best were from the skyscraper technique .   now you try it   i hope you can see the potential of the skyscraper technique for your site and your business .   yes , it takes hard work to create something great .   but with this strategy you already know ahead of time that your hard work is going to pay off ( unlike pumping out reams of content hoping that something goes viral ) .',\n",

              " '10 incredible business proposal ideas . here are ten of the most creative business proposal ideas from some of the best companies around . take these ideas , use them as your own and let them inspire you to improve your business proposals .   the comparison checklist from tony isgrove   if there ’s one industry you would n’t think would be at the forefront of proposal design and innovation , it ’s probably the painting and decorating industry . tony isgrove and his team came up with something absolutely genius .   as part of his business proposal idea he includes a helpful checklist so you can easily compare his painting service to that of anyone else . this is how it looked :   nothing revolutionary you might think , but this is where he ’s so so clever . he ’s setting the frame . now not only is he plugging all the things they do , accreditations they ’ve won etc but even if another painter ticks every single box , he would still only be just as good as tony ’s firm .   absolutely masterful frame control there .   “ lets do this , mate ” from sampath   a simple thing with a deep psychological impact . sampath , a growth consultant changed an otherwise normal piece of copy on the cover of his business proposal and created an awesome moment .   on covers in better proposals , you can edit the copy of the button from “ read proposal ” to anything you like . usually people just write things like “ open proposal ” , “ view quote ” or “ start reading ” . a skilled content or essay writing service provider can help you to write better call - to - action lines .   not sampath .   he builds a fantastic relationship with his clients so this does n’t seem weird and of course , in the wrong situation , this is terrible advice so tread with caution , but he changed his button name to “ let ’s do this , mate ” .   it creates a cool “ yeahhhhhhh ! ” moment and they are few and far between in proposals . consider what you call the button on your proposal covers .   testimonial on the page with the quote on it from jigawatt   jigowatt are a digital agency in the uk and do something that can only be described as sheer brilliance . they are n’t a cheap design agency and their pricing reflects that . what they do to “ soften the blow ” to people who might be expecting a lower price is add a testimonial which conveniently touts the roi of jigowatt ’s services .   absolute magic . it ’s so good in - fact that we have completely stolen this business proposal idea for our proposal templates . here ’s how it looks : # sorrynotsorry   personalised video introduction from kevin at blinkered   kevin at blinkered does something brilliant with his proposals . he ’s a digital strategist based near glasgow , scotland .   he ’s committed to making each of his proposals as personal as he can so he records a personalised introduction video for each and every client and embeds the video on the introduction page of his proposal .   now only does this scream “ i want the job ” but it shows how ‘ on the ball ’ he is when it comes to winning business . i wish more people adopted this approach . what ’s even better is he does n’t use an iphone in selfie mode . that would n’t be his style .   he gets his entire camera gear out in a mini - studio he ’s created for himself and shoots it professionally . this is all about using your strengths to your advantage . he has awesome camera gear , and video editing tools speaks amazingly well and has a studio .   personalising the cover from tim   tim coe is a marketer and brand strategist from lymington in hampshire . he ’s the author of the book ‘ your utterly seductive proposal ’ and has been featured on grant cardone ’s tv show , has done business with a who ’s who of business people in the uk and has spoken at every conference worth speaking at .   he takes personalising each proposal seriously much like _ _ _ _ _ but does it in his own way . he personalises each cover dependant on the client and project . i love this .   think about it . it ’s the first thing they see so making an amazing first impression is really important . he uses unsplash.com and finds an appropriate picture then uses that as the background cover . an excellent touch and one you should employ .   case study idea with a story from templates   sometimes we get so boxed into pre - existing ideas we forget to step outside the box . i was on a flight to barcelona recently to watch the football and the amazing 6 - 1 win over psg , and on the flight i wrote a new business proposal template .   only , i was on the plane , i had no internet so i wrote the content in pages on my mac which took me out of “ business proposal writing ” mode and more into a natural flow . when it came to writing the case study part i for some reason wrote it as if it was a personal introduction .   it was a little story of a guy called jamie , and jamie oddly enough had the same goals as the imaginary prospect and it only made sense we ’d share this story seeing as we helped jamie achieve all his goals .   why is this effective ? it ’s different , it ’s reading a success story without your “ bullshit filter ” on so it actually goes in your brain . give this a try . remember , the trick is to make it super personal .   big coloured block exclaiming the goal of the project   we launched feature blocks in january of 2017 and they ’ve been used in almost every business proposal that ’s been sent since . an absolutely massive hit .   what they ’ve been used for most commonly is making a big point of the opening statement on the introduction page . the trick with this is less in the design but more in the copy . if someone wants to double their revenue in the next 12 months and that is of paramount importance then something like this will give an epic first impression .   it grabs attention , forces them to take that piece of information in and sets the tone for the rest of the proposal .   letting your client upsell themselves with the optional items in your business proposal ideas   troy dean from at wp elevation – they ’re one of our premium partners , suggests in his wp elevation blueprint course that you should always allow your client to upsell themselves with a few extra add - ons .   it could be a monthly report , extra support , vip treatment or any number of things but allowing them the chance to increase the deal size by clicking one button is a brilliant touch .   in fact , the business proposal idea was so good , we built it right into our pricing tables . here ’s how it looks .   if you want to impress your clients with technological brilliance as well as increasing the revenue you bring in from each client , look no further than this little beauty .   the fact that it ’s web based to begin with .   how many times have you asked for a quote or a proposal and received a tacky , badly designed document with a brief description of the service and a price ? too often ?   sending a web based business proposal that arrives with a beautiful full screen cover , well formatted text and engaging to browse is far more interesting .   our unofficial tagline here at better proposals is “ death of the pdf ” . it ’ll never die but we can try and make it obsolete .   projections from tim ’s proposal “ picture the dream ”   here ’s another brilliant business proposal idea from tim coe . if you ’re creating a business proposal which contains future projections for your client then consider setting the stage nice and early with those projections .   i ’m not suggesting replace the introduction . you should always have that opening summary , but this could immediately follow . this way , you ’re hitting them with the main benefit nice and early , then painting this amazing picture for them sets the frame up perfectly .   now , everything they read in the rest of the proposal is understood through these lens of knowing what year 2 and 3 could look like . subtle tip here , getting people to “ think big ” before hitting them with the price is a great way of lowering the impact your price would have .   conclusion   there are ten amazing business proposal ideas for you to jazz up your proposals , make them more engaging and fun to read . a lot of sending your proposal is of course about doing a good job for the agreed budget , but it ’s also about making them feel like you ’re the right company for the job .   a great way to do that is give them an organised , well formatted document summing everything up . if that is a complete mess , what does it say about your service ? conversely , what does it say if it blows them away ?   i ’ll leave you to work out which one you want to be .',\n",

famous media persona , not a random girl off the street . her popularity is her ethos .   in the context of essays , you can reference to credible personas and organizations in your work . their ethos is what can help your arguments sound persuasive .   five elements of persuasion in your essay   persuasive essays have no paragraph limits . you can write one body paragraph to explain your position , and another paragraph – to describe counterarguments of your opponents and why you disagree . or , you are welcome to write 2 - 3 - 4 paragraphs with arguments and counterarguments to persuade readers .   but here ’s what matters :   for your persuasive essay to sound credible and argumentative , make sure it has the following five elements inside :   your clear position . make your thesis narrow in focus . it can be a claim , a fact , a definition , a solution , or a call of judgment . feel free to use our thesis statement generator to introduce the idea of your essay . it should present your position on the topic . effective communication . hook the audience ’s attention with some background information on the topic . you can start with a question , inviting them to keep on reading to find out your opinion . use straightforward language , do n’t manipulate with readers ’ emotions .   it ’s all about pathos : your writing voice and style is more likely to persuade readers than boring and vague language with tons of grammar mistakes .   your solid ( + credible ) argument . make it logical , consistent , and fact - based . it should address the interests of those you want to persuade and be endorsed by authoritative third parties .   consider your audience . what do they already know about the topic ? what do they think of it ? do they agree or disagree , and what are the chances to change their opinion ? are there any sensitive issues about the topic ?   remember the formula : one paragraph = one argument + one reason why you think like that . and make each reason logically connected to your thesis statement .   what evidence can you use to support arguments ?   proven facts   statistics   definitions   research   quotes from experts   examples to illustrate your point of view , including your personal experience   relevant emotional appeals   this guy from smrt english will help you get a better idea of what it ’s all about . perfect for those who choose watching over reading . 😉   clear structure . organize your persuasive essay so every argument would relate to the thesis . start with the weaker argument and build your essay up to the stronger point for readers to remember the most convincing information . and pay attention to transitions and connections between paragraphs to show the relationships between arguments in the essay and make it easy to follow . strong conclusion . restate your thesis in the light of the evidence you ’ve provided in the essay . make your conclusion logically draw from your arguments .   how to write a persuasive essay : step by step   the most common questions students ask are how to start a persuasive essay and how to end a persuasive essay .   but they forget one tiny detail here :   they need to take at least four steps before the actual essay writing . here it goes , the process of persuasive essay writing , step by step :   source : giphy   step 1 – choose your position   a persuasive essay is called so because the issue you describe there is polemical . it means you can argue both for and against it . but it ’s crucial to decide which side you are going to support before writing your essay . in other words , you need to know the purpose of your persuasive essay .   for example , if you are going to write about global warming or green marketing but you personally believe that it ’s not the problem of herculean proportions , you can choose the corresponding position to describe in your essay .   but :   make sure you can find enough evidence to support it . for a persuasive essay , it should be based on solid research and credible arguments . do you have them to back your cynicism about the climate change problem ?   step 2 – do research   to convince readers of your position , you need to know the topic inside out and understand it from multiple angles . and given that your persuasive essay should provide convincing evidence for your claims , you ’ll have to do research to find them .   it ’s not only about your personal experience and knowledge but also academic studies , historical examples , relevant media news , and expert opinions . to gather them , you might need to visit libraries or interview opinion leaders . or , you might want to send them emails and ask for their expert thoughts to use as references in the essay .   when choosing evidence and resources to cite in your essay , consider the craap test to evaluate them :   how to evaluate sources and understand if you can use them as references in essays   the craap method :   yes , it takes time . so make sure to save it for research and do n’t cut it close the deadline . vague assumptions and unverified information wo n’t work here .   step 3 – identify the strongest evidence   once the research is ready , you may have many different aspects to cover the topic . but you ca n’t write about all of them . choose the one with the strongest evidence that will help to support your position , and concentrate on it for stating the thesis of your persuasive essay .   do n’t hurry up to choose the most commonly argued aspect . if you ’ve gathered enough evidence for a rarely discussed problem around your topic and essay purpose – focus on it .   for example , if you claim that people have no impact on global warming and you ’ve found a few latest but not - yet - widely discussed studies on the topic , it might be great evidence to provide .   step 4 – write a persuasive essay outline   and now , for the most interesting part :   outline writing .   before you sit and start a persuasive essay , write its plan . it ’s a kinda map for you to understand how your essay will look , and it helps you make sure you do n’t miss anything from its structure .   here is the template for you to use :   persuasive essay outline i. introduction a ) lead / hook ( quote , question , anecdote )   b ) lead / hook explanation   c ) thesis statement ii . body . paragraph-1 a ) topic sentence ( the first main point in the thesis )   b ) quote ( to support the point )   c ) explanation of the quote   d ) explanation of how this quote relates to the thesis iii . body . paragraph-2 a ) topic sentence ( the second main point in the thesis )   b ) quote ( to support the point )   c ) explanation of the quote   d ) explanation of how this quote relates to the thesis iv . body . paragraph-3 a ) topic sentence ( the third main point in the thesis , or a counterargument to the thesis )   b ) quote ( to support the point )   c ) explanation of the quote   d ) explanation of how this quote relates to the thesis v. conclusion a ) summary of all main points   b ) thesis restatement   c ) call to action or what you want readers to do after reading your essay   the outline allows you to specify all core components of your persuasive essay so you would n’t get lost in the writing process .   step 5 – write a draft of your persuasive essay   finally !   once the outline is ready , just sit and write your essay . do n’t concentrate on spelling or grammar mistakes , and do n’t get distracted from the process of writing itself . just let your thoughts flow , do n’t hurry up to edit .   source : giphy   after you ’ve finished the draft , put it aside , and wait for a couple of hours or a day . you need some time between the writing process and proofreading / editing your essay : it helps to judge your work with a fresh eye and see if there are any weak points to revise .   step 6 – proofread and edit   it ’s not about spell check only . when editing a persuasive essay , you need to re - check arguments once again , make sure your language is appropriate ( avoid pompous or jargon phrases ) , and the overall essay structure is n’t too complex .   questions to answer when editing :   editing your essay : questions to answer ■ did i answer the question given in the assignment ?   ■ did i structure my essay right ?   ■ did i make all paragraphs clear and coherent ?   ■ did i use the appropriate language throughout my essay ?   ■ did i cite and reference all resources in the right way ?   ■ did i exceed the word limit ?   ■ did i proofread my essay for spelling and grammar errors ?   ■ did i present the assignment well ?   also , you can use free editing apps and tools to check your persuasive essay for errors . for example , the hemingway app will help to make your writing concise ; grammarly will spot spelling , punctuation , and style mistakes ; and prowritingaid will count the words in your essay and also fix your grammar mistakes .   but if it still sounds difficult to you , feel free to ask academic writers and editors for the professional help . they ’ll comment on your mistakes so you ’ll improve writing skills and craft your future essay better .   persuasive essay samples   that ’s all well and fine , but are there any examples of how a great persuasive essay looks ?   here go samples for your consideration .

              " 'toms shoes : doing more harm than good ? . toms shoes : doing more harm than good ?       a single idea can change the world . – blake mycoskie , founder , toms shoes   in 2006 , american blake mycoskie traveled to argentina and befriended children who could not afford shoes . these children not only were susceptible to foot sores and soil - transmitted diseases , but also could not attend school since shoes were “ a required part of their uniform ” ( toms official website ) . wanting to help , mycoskie created toms shoes , formerly known as “ shoes for a better tomorrow , ” a 90 employee operation headquartered in southern california , which offers stylish cloth and canvas shoes ( hubbard and pink ) . ( see exhibit 1 which portrays the wide variety of designs and styles that toms offers ) . toms ’ business model , however , is unorthodox because for every pair of shoes it sells , it donates a pair of new shoes to a child in need , known as the “ one for one ” initiative ( toms official website ) . the one - for - one initiative “ transforms toms ’ customers into benefactors , ” which allows mycoskie ’s company to become “ a truly sustainable business rather than [ a charity dependent ] on fundraising for support ” ( msn ) . ( see exhibit 2 which provides greater detail on the one - for - one model in action ) . mycoskie and his team travel the globe to distribute footwear to children in underprivileged areas ( hubbard ) . as mycoskie puts it : “ every time a customer slips on a pair of classics , cordones , or stitchouts , he gets a reminder of the contributions he ’s made to the world ” ( pink ) . ( see exhibit 3 for toms ’ marketing campaign ) . in this paper , i will describe how toms ’ successful , socially - driven business model disproves milton friedman ’s doctrine of corporate social responsibility . moreover , using edward freeman ’s stakeholder theory , i will illustrate philanthropists ’ criticisms towards toms ’ famous one - for - one initiative .   toms ’ history   the toms phenomenon hit the united states after a few los angeles boutiques agreed to sell mycoskie ’s shoes ( daniels 1 ) . american customers became toms ’ biggest market through word - of- mouth marketing . only a few months after toms hit the market , mycoskie was flying out of new york and casually asked a woman why she was wearing toms shoes . not knowing who he was , the woman enthusiastically began to tell him about the “ mission of the company , the founder ’s background and that they were n’t just any ordinary shoes ” ( flandez ) . americans were attracted to the good intentions behind mycoskie ’s business ( schectman ) .   american corporations , including at&t and polo ralph lauren , also began collaborating with toms ( flandez ) . ralph lauren designed a special line of toms for his rugby brand to help the brand establish credibility while at&t filmed a commercial about toms and followed mycoskie on a shoe drop to help raise awareness about the company ’s social mission ( keplesky ) . with the help of multiple corporations , customers , and social media , the company has grown exponentially . not only did toms give away its 1,000,000th pair of shoes in september 2010 , but it also has expanded to helping kids in twenty countries around the world through its health and human organization partners ( toms official website ) . toms relies on these non - governmental organizations [ ngos ] to coordinate shoe drop offs and help accommodate children who outgrow their first pair of shoes ( msn ) .   a day without shoes   to increase further awareness about the shoeless children in developing countries , toms founded “ a day without shoes ” in 2007 . the purpose of the event was to get people talking : “ the idea [ was ] to spread the word by asking those [ people ] why they were [ not wearing shoes ] ” ( decker ) . ( see exhibit 4 to see the thank you video for 2012 ’s “ a day without shoes ” ) . mycoskie elaborated as to why toms was asking everyone around the world to participate in this event :   i think sometimes , we forget what we have , and occasionally it ’s important to remind ourselves . most people do n’t even how many children in developing countries grow up barefoot and all the risks , infections and diseases they endure … i want everyone to personally understand the impact of shoes , and the difference they can make : why do n’t we get a taste of what these kids go through every day ? ( toms official website )   with the help of celebrities such as kristen bell , the dallas cowboys cheerleaders , and the jonas brothers , the event continuously enjoys tremendous turnout ( mycoskie ) . ( see exhibit 5 for toms ’ 2011 “ a day without shoes ” advertisement ) . last year , over 250,000 people across twenty - five countries participated in the event and the turnout for 2012 is predicated to be even greater .   does toms ’ business model make it less competitive ?   milton friedman would condemn toms ’ business model because he believes that businesses ’ sole purpose is to generate profits for its shareholders . friedman claims that companies are less competitive when they incorporate social responsibility into their business plans ( friedman 121 ) . he would cry foul over toms ’ “ philanthropic capitalism ” because the company incorporates philanthropy into its business strategy , creating a cost rather than an opportunity for the firm ( daniels 2 ) . friedman would recommend charging the same price for each pair of shoes and then donating a “ significant ” amount of money to a ngo devoted to helping children in developing countries . in friedman ’s eyes , toms could then be considered socially responsible since the company would be pleasing its customers as well as its shareholders . in other words , companies do not need to go beyond “ the amount that is in the best interests of the corporation or required law ” to meet society ’s “ social ” needs ( friedman 123 ) .   doing good and doing well   mycoskie ’s entrepreneurship has disproved friedman ’s theory by successfully demonstrating that businesses can be both profitable and socially responsible ( brauer 90 ) . while many consider the company as philanthropic , toms is a “ for - profit company with giving at its core ” ( toms official website ) . toms ’ social mission , however , is “ integral to the competitive logic of the company ” because its brand does not exist outside its “ charity ” work ( pink and wsj ) . according to lisbeth den toom , senior editor of springwise , an amsterdam – based blog and newsletter that tracks new business ideas , “ without the connection to a larger cause , i doubt the toms brand would have grown as quickly or had as much staying power ” ( pink ) .   toms ’ giving - based business , in turn , has proven to be a “ powerful profit engine ” ( wsj ) . ( see exhibits 6 , 7 , and 8 to view the company ’s income statements and growth over the previous four years ) . while toms does not reveal its financial information , according to a 2009 cnbc show , it only costs toms $ 9 to produce each pair of shoes , while in turn , the price of shoes sold in stores ranges from $ 44 to over $ 100 , depending on the model ( cnbc ) . the price of the shoes “ cover[s ] the cost of the donated shoes and shoe drops , ” allowing toms to continue its socially - driven mission ( cbnc and daniels 3 ) . with its loyal customers supporting mycoskie ’s simple initiative , toms continues to maintain a profitable business , even in the current economic downturn .   philantropists ’ criticisms about toms ’ business model   most people would find it hard to understand why anyone would criticize toms shoes , especially since the company has been able to provide more than 1,000,000 pairs of shoes to children in developing countries worldwide . many philanthropists , however , have criticized toms because the company makes people in poor nations “ dependent upon the good will of others ” rather than creating opportunities for them to better themselves ( daniels 10 ) . toms does have a brilliant marketing strategy because it “ stirs up humanitarian concerns , ” but [ its ] actions may even violate thomas donaldson ’s first principle of “ do no harm ” ( values in capitalism ) . donaldson ’s first principle states that multinational - national corporations [ mncs ] need to fulfill their “ mandatory duty ” of not directly depriving citizens ’ fundamental international rights , such as the right to subsistence or physical security ( donaldson 147 , 149 ) . toms , unfortunately , deprives citizens in developing countries the right to subsistence because having a price of zero , according to apoorva shah , changes “ shoe economics regardless of how undeveloped the shoe market may be ” ( values in capitalism ) . local merchants who sell basic quality shoes , therefore , can no longer compete with free , creating more unemployment in already extremely poor areas ( watkins ) . there is no incentive for dependencies to end because toms competes with local producers “ by handing out free goods ” and being the “ quintessential whites in shining armor ” ( watkins ) . by not providing any additional solutions , poverty will continue to “ run rampant in the lives of children who just happen to now have new shoes ” ( macdonald ) .   critics also argue that toms business model , particularly its “ a day without shoes ” event , reinforces the pre - existing stereotypes of the poor and incapable developing countries . saundra schimmelpfeniig , founder of good intentions are not enough , has led several protests against the annual event , even hosting a counter campaign : “ a day without dignity ” ( paulson ) . other non - profits and charities , including project diaspora ( pd ) , have expressed their frustration with toms ’ “ raising awareness campaign ” because privileged citizens in the developed world are not talking with people in developing countries or becoming educated about their true needs ( project diaspora ) . one pd blogger , tukenia obasi , notes : “ the media has created enough awareness about poverty , starvation and war in the developing world . we really do n’t need another awareness campaign , especially not another condescending remind - ourselves exercise ” ( obasi ) . according to the “ a day without dignity ” video , t - shirts and shoes are not at the top of developing countries ’ priority lists . people want jobs that pay sustainable income and that will feed their families . ( see exhibit 9 to watch the complete “ a day without dignity ” video ) . there has been no formal response to “ a day without dignity ” from toms shoes , but mycoskie should realize that his company has the capability to be a driving force for economic change . unless we become truly educated about the crises that exist within the developing world , the vicious poverty cycle within those nations will continue .   stakeholder theory : who takes priority ?   over the last thirty years , the world has viewed corporations as “ the property of their shareholders in public corporations and limited in their liability for their effects upon others ” ( freeman 2010 ) . in an interview conducted at the university of virginia ’s darden business school , edward freeman claims that his stakeholder theory has been attempting to change that mindset by providing a framework for managers to understand the business environment and “ make sense of it ” ( darden ) . he argues that in order for any business to be successful , it has to create value for “ customers , suppliers , employees , communities , and financiers ” and make sure that all stakeholders ’ interests resonate together ( darden ) .   freeman argues that philosophers and social scientists define “ stakeholders ” in two different ways . philosophers believe that stakeholders are a way to bring accountability to business decisions , especially to those who can affect or be affected by the firm ( freeman 2000 ) . social scientists , on the other hand , view stakeholders as “ useful unit[s ] of analysis that easily depict the social and societal effects of the business ” ( freeman 2000 ) . stakeholders , in other words , force firms to consider the societal consequences of their business decisions , rather than just the economic ones . the key to businesses ’ success , according to freeman , is to not only have products and services that customers want , but also have good effects on the community or allow “ customers to do things in the community that they could n’t do otherwise ” ( darden ) .   in the case of toms shoes , mycoskie ’s business views the shoe recipients in developing countries across the world as “ units of analysis ” rather than as moral agents . toms believes that its social mission creates benefits for all of its stakeholders : a profitable business , loyal customers , and happy children in developing countries . the firm , on the other hand , seems to not fully comprehend the unintended consequences of its shoe giving . toms needs to be held accountable for the jobs lost and increased dependence on foreign “ kindness ” as a result of its one - for - one initiative . capitalism , according to freeman , is how businesses create value for their stakeholders and that capitalism only works when “ [ we ] desire to create value for each other , not our desire to compete ” ( darden ) . toms , unfortunately , has competed against local merchants and distributors , costing these individuals their jobs and sustainable income .   if toms shoes were to appoint me as ceo , i would make significant changes in their company ’s business model . first , toms first needs to establish relationships with community leaders in developing nations to understand their true needs . teams who participate in the shoe drop offs could lead round - table discussions to determine future potential partnerships . toms has the economic , social and political resources to implement positive change , but what could they do ? after reading shah ’s article , i have two proposals : toms should build local factories in these developing nations and employ local residents to make the shoes as well as incorporate local vendors into their supply chains ( values in capitalism ) . citizens within these countries not only would be receiving the shoes they need , but the company would also be creating additional employment and long - term relationships through foreign direct investment . instead of donating shoes for the one - for - one initiative , the extra money could go to helping support the operating costs of toms factories . toms would still be raising awareness about poverty within these nations as well as helping these people become economically independent in the long - term .   the future of toms   despite its critics , toms expanded its one - for - one initiative to eyeglasses in 2011 . after the company ’s shoe success , mycoskie ’s entrepreneurial mindset recognized that toms “ could be more than a shoe company - it should be a one - for - one company ” ( toms official website ) . the company chose sight as its next chapter due to its fundamental need . after mycoskie and a small team learned how blindness and vision - impairment conditions in developing countries were either preventable or curable , toms launched its eyewear line with the promise that for every pair of glasses sold , a child in need “ would receive medical care , prescription glasses , or sight - saving surgery ” ( toms official website ) . by attempting to understand the fundamental eyesight problems within developing countries , the company ’s latest initiative seems to be focused towards capacity building rather than merely giving away goods .   with the goal of giving sight to people all over the world , the company first started in nepal , cambodia and tibet . most recently , toms has expanded into impoverished areas in the united states , thanks to its partnership with the helen keller ’s international childsight program ( toms official website ) . toms ’ continued success demonstrates that companies no longer have to choose between earning profits and making a difference in the world , but it also sheds light on the fact that companies must consider the social and long - term economic consequences of their charitable actions .   exhibit 1 : an array of designs and styles that toms offers to its customers   exhibit 2 : toms ’ one - for - one model in action   http://www.toms.com/one-for-one   exhibit 3 : toms ’ marketing campaign   exhibit 4 : toms ’ “ a day without shoes ” 2012 video thank you video   http://www.onedaywithoutshoes.com/   exhibit 5 : 2011 ’s successful “ a day without shoes ”   exhibit 6 : toms ’ 2008 -

              " 'brand identity : how to develop a unique & memorable brand in 2022 . developing a brand identity requires more than creating a logo . although a logo can be the symbol of a business , it is not the entirety of a brand . in fact , creating a logo is just one small step toward developing a strong brand identity .   with millions , if not billions , of businesses trying to make a name for themselves , having a strong brand has become crucial for businesses to differentiate themselves from their competitors .   if you \\'re working to develop your first brand identity for a client , or you \\'re doing this for your own business , it \\'s important to first understand what a brand is and what it takes to create one . we ’ll explore strong examples of brand identities , plus how to create one for your own business , according to brand strategists .   jump to :   what is brand identity ? a brand identity is made up of what your brand says , what your values are , how you communicate your product , and what you want people to feel when they interact with your company . essentially , your brand identity is the personality of your business and a promise to your customers .   the terms \" brand \" and logo \" are often used interchangeably , but they are not the same . originally , the term \" brand \" was used to refer to the mark that cattle ranchers \" branded \" on their cattle . however , the idea of a \" brand \" has since evolved to encompass much more than just a name or a symbol .   a brand is a feature — or set of features — that distinguishes one organization from another . a brand is typically comprised of a name , tagline , logo or symbol , design , brand voice , and more .   brand identity , then , is the aspect of branding that focuses on your brand \\'s personality , as well as the values you convey to customers .   as wayfair senior brand manager jared rosen puts it , \" brand identity is more than just finding the right logo to place on coffee cup sleeves or mount above your front door . it \\'s about crafting a personality that amplifies the core elements to your brand \\'s dna . today , the most magnetic brand identities scale across digital platforms , irl experiences , and even naturally converse with real customers . \"   ultimately , your product leaves an impression on your customers long after you \\'ve made the sale . brand identity is the process of shaping that impression .   to further understand this concept , let \\'s explore some examples , next .   strong brand identity examples coca - cola hustle & hope greeting cards pop fit burt \\'s bees asana semicolon bookstore & gallery   image source   when you hear the name coca - cola , you probably picture its well - known logo , shown above .   but you also might think of the polar bear , the color red , its \" share a coke \" campaign , or the classic ribbon - like imagery featured on its cans . here are two things that comprise coca - cola \\'s brand identity :   coca - cola \\'s brand identity begins with a red logo in script text . the red color elicits confidence in the person who drinks a coke , while the script typeface is all about enjoyment . coffee , for example , is a drink you have before work in the morning . coca - cola is a drink you enjoy when you \\'re done in the afternoon . this is the brand \\'s \" face . \"   coca - cola prints its logo on a uniquely shaped bottle ( it \\'s true , no other beverages have bottles exactly like it ) . this tells customers they \\'re not getting an imitation — this is the real thing . the brand develops credibility and trust this way .   image source   hustle & hope is a brand that positions their products as more than a greeting card . their stationary and cards tackle more difficult topics such as job hunting and personal development . by pairing simple inspirational messaging with a code on the back of the card that leads to digital content and tips , the cards are meant to \" level up \" the recipient in some way .   founder ashley sutton always wanted to start a stationery company , but after a career working in some of the top fortune 500 companies , she became passionate about empowering people to be their best professional selves . that \\'s when she had an epiphany that would later become the basis of what makes her company unique : \" why not sell cool greeting cards and help people ! \" here \\'s how this brand \\'s identity is executed :   all the paper products use modern , colorful designs that pop off the page and slogans that go beyond generic well wishing .   the experience of scanning the code is a novelty that makes an impression , both with the product itself as well as its mission to drive an idea home .   image source   pop fit has a beautiful brand with bright pinks , purples , and yellows , but that \\'s not even a main element of their brand identity . perhaps one of the most stunning thing about this brand is their radical representation found in all their messaging . according to their website , \" pop fit clothing was built on the idea that representation , inclusivity , and body positivity matters in both fashion and media . \" this is why their sizes range from xxs to 4xl and feature signature fabric with a four - way stretch .   pop fit \\'s advertising supports their message of inclusivity , featuring women of color , wheelchair users , and diverse body types . their images are also un - retouched , showcasing their diverse models realistically and respectfully .   their products solve for massive pain points in the athletic clothing industry , such as sizing issues , lack of pockets , and transparency or rolling while doing squats and other exercises .   image source   after humble beginnings in beekeeping and selling honey , burt \\'s bees grew to meet the need for all - natural and sustainable personal products . the company seeks to \" make thoughtful choices to reduce our impact on nature and work to protect biodiversity , which preserves our own place in the world . \"   their initial logo ( pictured above ) depicting the bearded founder underscores the feeling of simplicity and modesty . this is in stark contrast to aesthetics that other beauty and personal care products embody . here \\'s how else the brand distances itself from flashiness , sticking to its nature - obsessed focus :   burt \\'s bees responsibly sources ingredients for their products and use recyclable packaging .   they donate to conservation projects and other green initiatives .   image source   asana \\'s mission is \" to help humanity thrive by enabling the world \\'s teams to work together effortlessly . \" the founders began at facebook , where it was clear that they needed a project management and collaboration tool that would enable the teams to work together more fluidly .   in sanskrit , \" asana \" refers to a specific pose in which yogis sit , and the company name is in homage to the buddhist principles of focus and flow . this , along with their values of \" doing great things , fast \" and teamwork , is manifested clearly in their visual brand , as well :   asana uses a lot of white space for focus with bursts of color to \" inject energy \" into the workspace .   the three dots in the logo are arranged together , signifying balance and collaboration .   image source   semicolon books was born when owner / operator danielle mullen chose to seize the day . after being diagnosed with a tumor on her ocular nerve , she was thinking about legacy . then , without expectation or intention to open a store , she walked by the perfect space for lease . not long after , the spot was hers , and she was building shelves .   the book store \\'s mission is in \" nurturing the connection between literature , art , and the pursuit of knowledge ; while also using the power of words to better our community . \" because of this , the brand is committed to the chicago community and cultivating a welcoming space for their customers :   their # cleartheshelves initiative allows local students to take home any books they want , free of charge , to impact literacy rates in chicago .   residents are encouraged to byob , chill in the store , and talk with the owner , creating an air of friendliness and camaraderie .   semicolon bookstore supports local creators by featuring local artists in the gallery and showcasing local authors .   you \\'ll also notice that their visual brand demonstrates a chicago vibe , while showing people reading and enjoying the store .   image source   marcella nyc started out of founder siyana huszar apartment and grew to a notable brand , blending classic silhouettes with an effortless look . her goal was to make affordable , high - end clothing and also take a more sustainable approach to fashion .   \" i really wanted to dress a woman like me : someone who wanted to feel empowered and strong and understated but not afraid to stand out in a crowd , \" siyana said in an interview with forbes . \" my designs are very minimalist , very simple , but there \\'s always a little bit of a twist or a cool edge to it .   empowering women and girls became an integral part of marcella nyc ’s brand identity .   the clothing takes on a monochromatic , uniform look : black , gray , white , and camel . perfect for building a capsule wardrobe with a cohesive look .   staying true to their women ’s empowerment ethos , each item of clothing customers buy supports a full week of school for girls in need : books , supplies , uniforms , and hygienic items .   keeping their commitment to sustainability , the brand uses organic and sustainable fabrics when possible , uses recycled materials in addition to biodegradable packaging .   each of these facets work together to create a cohesive brand identity . when you look at any item of clothing , you know it ’s marcella nyc .   in the above examples , brand is so much bigger than the logo or visuals for the business . we \\'ll talk more about this in the sections below .   why is brand identity so important ?   as the embodiment of almost everything your business is and does , a brand identity can inspire customers and increase a sense of loyalty for your brand . brand identity , therefore , is crucial to your business \\'s future .   so , if your brand is more than just its logo , how can you replicate what brands like coca - cola have done and instill other unique elements into your business \\'s identity ?   here are six components of a well - developed brand identity , and why it \\'s so important for you to develop them .   the \" face \" of your business   for all intents and purposes , your brand \\'s logo is the \" face \" of your business . but that face should do more than just look cool or interesting — a logo \\'s contribution to brand identity is associative , too . it tells the public that [ this image ] means [ the name of your company ] .   credibility and trust   having a brand identity does n\\'t just make your product more memorable ; it makes your brand more authoritative in the marketplace . a brand that establishes a face , and maintains that face consistently over time , develops credibility among its competitors and trust among its customers .   advertising impressions   a brand identity is a template for everything you would include on an advertisement for your business — whether that ad is in print , online , or a preroll commercial on youtube . a brand with a face and industry credibility is well prepared to promote itself and make impressions on potential buyers .   your company \\'s mission   when you create an identity for your brand , you \\'re giving it something to stand for . that , in turn , gives your company a purpose . we all know companies have mission statements , right ? well , you ca n\\'t have one without first giving your brand an identity .   generating new customers and delighting existing ones   a brand identity — one with a face , trust , and a mission — attracts people who agree with what your brand has to offer . but once these people become customers , that same brand identity gives them a sense of belonging . a good product generates customers , but a good brand generates advocates .   if you want your business to become a well - known and beloved brand name , it \\'s going to take some work . the following steps will help you build a brand identity . they are simple steps — implementing them , however , is another story .   how to create a brand identity research your audience , value proposition , and competition . design the logo and a template for it . integrate language you can use to connect , advertise , and embody on social media . know what to avoid . monitor your brand to maintain its brand identity .   building a brand is not something that should be done hastily . there are a lot of moving parts that go beyond creating a logo and choosing some key colors . creating a brand identity will require the following :   1 . research your audience , value proposition , and competition .   just like any other aspect of starting a business , the first step in creating a brand identity is to complete market research . you should clarify and understand these five things .   as hubspot brand strategist james zabik told me , \" one of the most important things to consider when building a brand identity is how your messaging will resonate with your target audience . start by finding out your audience \\'s pain points and communicating how your company or product helps solve them . \"   zabik adds , \" you might have a flashy logo and eye - catching marketing copy , but if it does n\\'t address your customers \\' pain points clearly and effectively , it \\'ll be challenging to build a strong and lasting brand identity . \"   audience   it \\'s no secret that different people want different things . you ca n\\'t ( usually ) target a product to a pre - teen the same way you would target a product to a college student . learning what your audience wants from a business in your industry is vital to creating a brand people will love .   value proposition & competition   what makes your business unique in your industry ? what can you offer your consumers that others ca n\\'t ? knowing the difference between you and your competition is imperative to developing a successful brand . keeping an eye on your competitors will also educate you on what branding techniques work well — as well as those that do n\\'t .   mission   you know what your business offers , but be sure to have a clear and direct mission statement that describes your vision and goals . in other words , know your business \\'s purpose — you ca n\\'t very well create a personality for a business unless you know what that business is about .   hubspot senior brand manager callie wilkinson says , \" do n\\'t be afraid to stand for something . now more than ever , customers are drawn to brands that align with their values . inject your mission and vision into everything you do , and pursue meaningful partnerships with people and organizations that share those values . \"   personality   even though you \\'re not necessarily branding an individual , that does n\\'t mean that you ca n\\'t be personable when developing a brand image . use your type , colors , and imagery to represent who the brand is . then enhance that visual representation with your tone of voice : are you a confident business with a lot of sass , like nike ? or are you ritzy and professional , like givenchy ? either way , be sure to develop your brand as a way to represent your business .   research may be boring , but the more you know about your business , the stronger your brand identity will be .   swot analysis   finally , completing a swot analysis can be beneficial to better understand your brand . considering the characteristics of the brand will help you find characteristics you want to portray in the brand .   swot stands for :   strengths : positive characteristics of your business that provide an advantage over your competition .   weaknesses : characteristics that prove to be a disadvantage to your business .   opportunities : changes and trends in your industry that offer opportunities for your business .   threats : elements in the environment or industry that may cause problems for your business .   2 . design the logo and a template for it .   once you know your business inside and out , it \\'s time to bring your brand to life . in the words of graphic designer paul rand , \" design is the silent ambassador of your brand . \" here \\'s what you \\'ll need to know :   logo   although the logo is not the entirety of the brand identity , it \\'s a vital element in the branding process — it \\'s the most recognizable part of your brand . it \\'s on everything from your website to your business cards to your online ads . with your logo on all of these elements , your branding should look as cohesive as this example :   image source   interesting form   as imperative as your logo is to branding , it \\'s not the only element that makes a brand identity strong . your product(s ) , the packaging , or the way you present your services all need to play a part in your brand identity . visually representing your business in everything you do will create consistency and help create a familiarity with your consumers . take mcdonald \\'s golden arches as an example . they used an interesting form to create the iconic \" m , \" which is now recognizable all over the world .   color & type   creating a color palette is a way to enhance your identity . it provides you with variety so you can create unique designs for your business while remaining faithful to the brand identity .   type can also be a double - edged sword if not used properly . although \" mix and match \" type design has become quite the trend , that does n\\'t mean mixing a handful of fonts is necessarily a good idea for your business . in your logo , on your website , and on any documents that your business creates ( print and digital ) , there should be consistent use of typography . if you take a look at nike \\'s website and its ads , it keeps the same typeface and type style throughout all aspects of the business — and it works wonders for them .   templates   you probably send out emails , type up letters , or hand out business cards to potential customers on a daily basis . creating templates ( even for a detail as minute as email signatures ) will give your business a more unified , credible , and professional look and feel .   consistency   as mentioned in nearly every step already ( i ca n\\'t stress it enough ) , consistency is what can make or break a brand identity . use the aforementioned templates and follow the design choices you \\'ve decided upon for your brand throughout all areas of your business to create a harmonious brand identity .   flexibility   yes , consistency is crucial — but remaining flexible in a society that is always looking for the next best thing is just as important .   flexibility allows for adjustments in ad campaigns , tag - lines , and even some modernizing to your overall brand identity so you can continuously keep your audience interested . the key is keeping any changes you make consistent throughout your entire brand ( e.g. , do n\\'t change the design of your business cards and nothing else ) .   document   one of the most effective ways to ensure a business sticks to its branding \" rules \" is to create a set of brand guidelines that document all of the do \\'s and don\\'ts of your brand .   skype is one brand that has done an amazing job creating a clear , cohesive brand guide that anyone can follow . this is one way to empower people to build brand assets and share your brand while remaining brand compliant .   3 . integrate language you can use to connect , advertise , and embody on social media .   now that you \\'ve established your brand within your company and have taken all the necessary steps to develop it , you \\'re ready to integrate your brand within your community .   and one of the most successful ways to accomplish this is for your brand to provide quality content . in hubspot \\'s ebook branding in the inbound age , patrick shea writes , \" in every way , your content is your brand online . it \\'s your salesperson , your store , your marketing department ; it \\'s your story , and every piece of content you publish reflects on , and defines , your brand . so , great content , great brand . boring content , boring brand . \"   language   use language that matches the personality of your brand . if your brand identity is high - end , use professional language ; if your brand is laid - back , be more conversational . the language you choose to use as a brand will be integrated throughout the entire business , so it \\'s important that you carefully craft your tone to match your brand \\'s personality .   connection & emotion   people love stories . more accurately , people love stories that move them ( emotionally and to action ) . a strong brand identity can establish an emotional connection with consumers , which can be a solid foundation for building a lasting relationship with a brand .   advertise   designing ads , whether traditional or digital , is the most efficient way of introducing your brand to the world . it \\'s a way to get the message of your brand seen and heard by your target audience .   social media   another great way to establish a connection with your consumers is through social media . the plethora of platforms on the internet offers up a ton of digital real estate you can use to establish your brand identity . coca - cola , once again , makes great use of its facebook cover photo real estate by keeping it consistent with the happiness theme .   image source   social media is also important when it comes to conversing directly with your customers and creating affinity for your brand . if you \\'re mentioned in a tweet , status , or post ( especially if the customer has a question or concern ) , be sure to give your brand a good reputation by responding efficiently to your customers .   4 . know what to avoid .   you can follow all the steps of creating a strong brand identity , but if you \\'re guilty of any of the following practices , your brand might falter or fail .   do n\\'t give your customers mixed messages .   know what you want to say , and use the appropriate language and visuals to say it . just because it makes sense to you does n\\'t mean it will make sense to your customers .   do n\\'t copy your competitors .   your competition may have exemplary branding , and since you \\'re selling the same products or services , you might want to do what you know works — do n\\'t . take what they do into account , and put your own twist on it to make your business stand out in your industry even more .   do n\\'t lose consistency between online and offline .   yes , your print material might look a little different than your online presence , but your colors , type , theme , and message should all be consistent .   scale , do n\\'t sacrifice .   rosen told me , \" as your brand scales onto new channels , resist the urge to simply chase trends that do n\\'t align with your brand \\'s dna . scaling identity only works when you iterate off your original song sheet … rather than writing a new song entirely . \"   5 . monitor your brand to maintain its brand identity .   similar to other aspects of your marketing , it \\'s difficult to know what you \\'re doing right ( and what you \\'re not ) without tracking key performance metrics .   use google analytics , surveys , comments , social media discussions , etc . , to monitor your brand and get a sense of how people talk about and interact with you . this will give you the opportunity to implement changes to your brand as needed — whether it \\'s to correct a mistake or to improve brand identity .   as zabik puts it , \" test , learn , and optimize . figure out what sets your brand apart from your competitors and learn to communicate that in a way that builds trust . if your product lives up to the hype you create , you \\'ll start to build momentum with customers that believe in your brand . \"   create a memorable brand identity that resonates with customers   creating a memorable brand requires consistent use of type , color , images , and language , but it \\'s worth it . when consumers instantly recognize who you are and what you stand for all based on a logo , you \\'ve become more than just a name and a symbol .   editor \\'s note : this post was originally published in january 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness .',\n",

              " '17 email marketing best practices that actually drive results . while email marketing may not get the attention some newer marketing channels get , it \\'s still a terrific way for you to generate leads and convert more prospects for your business .   with that in mind , i want to share some email marketing best practices you can use to generate more leads for your business .   email marketing best practices do n\\'t purchase contact lists . avoid using \\' no - reply \\' in the sender \\'s email address . stick to fewer than three typefaces . optimize the email \\'s preview text . include an email signature . clean your mailing list regularly . keep the main message and call - to - action above the fold . personalize the email greeting . keep your email between 500 and 650 pixels wide . split test different subject lines and calls to action . include your logo . name the offer in your subject line . allow recipients to subscribe to your newsletter . write compelling ( but concise ) subject lines . use auto - responders for opt - ins . closely tie emails to landing pages . conduct a five - second test .   1 . do n\\'t purchase contact lists .   this first tip should come as no surprise , but given the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ) , it bears repeating .   email campaigns depend on a healthy open rate , and if you \\'re contacting people whose information you bought – rather than earned from a previous interaction – you \\'ll quickly see your emails \\' performance drop .   the gdpr also requires each european recipient \\'s consent before you reach out to them , and purchased email lists usually do not come with that consent .   for help reaching your target audience , consider versium reach – a platform made for b2b marketers that allows you to own data on your target audience across multiple marketing channels .   2 . avoid using \\' no - reply \\' in the sender \\'s email address .   have you heard of can - spam ? this longstanding piece of legislation is a popular and important guideline for all email marketers in the u.s.   one major rule in can - spam is to never use the words \" no reply , \" or a similar phrase , as your email sender \\'s name ( for example , \" noreply@yourcompany.com \" ) .   \" no reply \" in an email message prevents recipients from responding and even opting out of further emails , which can - spam protects their right to do so at any time .   instead , have your automated emails come from a first name ( for example , jamie@mycompany.com ) . your customers are much more likely to open emails if they know they were written by a human being and it keeps you compliant with email regulations .   3 . stick to fewer than three typefaces .   the less clutter you have in your email , the more conversions you \\'ll get .   do n\\'t junk up your email with more than two fonts or typefaces , as that can distract readers and ruin your email ’s visual appeal .   in addition , you want to use web - safe fonts with sizes between 10 - point and 12 - point . this ensures your email will be legible on all readers and devices .   4 . optimize the email \\'s preview text .   if you subscribe to a newsletter , you ’ve likely seen a message like this at the top of your email : “ email not displaying correctly ? click here . ”   do n\\'t get me wrong – it \\'s a helpful warning but keeping it in the preview text of your email ( also known as the preheader ) can drastically impact your email ’s open rate .   firstly , because you ’re telling recipients , “ hey , this email might not work . \" secondly , it does n’t provide any insight into what the email is about .   your preview text should supplement your subject line by adding in details to capture your audience ’s attention and encourage them to open .   by default , preview text pulls in the first several words of the email body and displays it next to the subject line before the person opens it .   the problem is custom email templates often stick with conditional statements like \" ca n\\'t see images ? \" or \" not displaying correctly ? \" at the top banner , allowing it to slip right into the preview when it goes out .   as a rule of thumb , always write a custom preheader that teases what your email will offer .   pro - tip : hubspot users can fix this problem by customizing the preview text themselves in the backend of their email marketing newsletter .   5 . include an email signature .   even if your newsletter is technically being sent to your contacts on behalf of the company , rather than an individual , the email should include the signature of a specific person .   in a 2019 state of business email marketing study , 41 % of marketers said they use email signatures for branding and visibility . the second most popular reason for its use was to maintain standard , cohesive sign - offs across all their companies .   another reason you should include your email signature is that it ’s a touch of personalization . people are naturally more inclined to read an email if they know it came from a human being , not just a collective marketing team . your email signature is your ticket to their attention .   want a quick way to make a beautiful email signature ? use hubspot \\'s email signature generator . we also have an out - of - office email generator to make your response to incoming messages just as delightful .   6 . clean your mailing list regularly .   some of your email contacts might not opt - out of your email campaign , but will still never open your emails .   it \\'s tempting to email as many people as possible to reach more prospects , but keeping your least - engaged recipients on your mailing list can kill your open rate . people who never open emails make your campaign look worse since you \\'re not analyzing the campaign \\'s quality against your most loyal recipients .   review your list of subscribers who have n’t engaged with your emails over a certain period of time , and remove them on a regular basis . this gives you a more accurate email open rate and keeps your email campaign clean of the people who are no longer interested in hearing from you .   you can also implement a workflow in which they ’re gradually moved to a less frequent email list based on activity .   for instance , say you have a daily newsletter . you could implement a workflow in which subscribers who do not open your email in two consecutive weeks are moved to the weekly email . then , those subscribers could be moved to the monthly newsletter if they do n’t open 4 consecutive emails . and so on .   it keeps you from bombarding your subscribers with emails they ’re not interested in while keeping your list clean .   7 . keep the main message and call - to - action above the fold .   above the fold refers to the information that ’s visible to the reader before they scroll down .   even though recent research suggests that consumers scroll more than they used to – because of social media and vertical timelines – above the fold content still gets the most attention .   eyetracking research from neilsen norman group found that consumers spend 57 % of their viewing time on above - the - fold content . that number drastically goes down to 17 % of the second screenful and gradually decreases as they scroll .   with this in mind , place your message and cta above the fold . it ’s the first thing your recipients will see once they open your email , therefore increasing your conversion rate .   you can also run an a / b test first to validate the hypothesis and see if it works for your emails .   8 . personalize the email greeting .   how often do you read emails that begin , \" dear member \" ?   you might segment your email audiences by the type of customer they are ( member , subscriber , user , etc . ) , but it should n\\'t be the first thing recipients see in your company messages .   personalizing the greeting of your emails with your contacts \\' first names grabs the attention of each reader right away . for hubspot users , this is called a personalization token , and creating one looks like this :   then , the address line of your email would automatically produce the contact \\'s first name by fetching this personalization token in the email \\'s html , like this : hi , !   do n\\'t worry , personalizing an email \\'s greeting line with 50 recipients \\' names does n\\'t mean you \\'ll have to manually write and send 50 different emails from now on .   many email marketing tools today allow you to configure the greeting of your email campaign so that it automatically sends with the name of the people on your contact list – so everyone is getting a personal version of the same message .   9 . keep your email around 500 to 650 pixels wide .   if your email template is wider than 650 pixels , your email wo n’t show up correctly and will require users to scroll horizontally to read the full email .   this is a pain , to say the least , and will likely affect your conversion .   having your template fit within the standard format will make for easier readability , better conversions , and an overall better user experience .   10 . split test your subject lines and calls to action .   if you ca n\\'t seem to increase your email \\'s open and click - through rates , a couple of things might be wrong : you \\'re not emailing the right people ( are you buying your contact list ? see the first tip at the top of this blog post ) , or the content needs to be improved .   to start , focus on the latter , and conduct an a / b test .   a / b tests can be used to improve almost any of your digital marketing content . in an email , this test splits your recipients into two groups : group a receives the regular newsletter , while group b receives the newsletter with a specific variation .   this variation tests to see if your audience would be more or less likely to take an action based on that element .   hubspot marketing hub users can conduct email a / b tests on anything from the subject line to the call - to - action ( cta ) inside it .   for example , you might change the color of your cta from red to green to see if your email \\'s clickthrough rate increases . if it does , the test indicates that you should change your emails \\' cta color to green from now on .   11 . include your logo .   logos are a must when it comes to emails .   a 2020 study by red sift and entrust found that logos positively impact email engagement as well as brand recall .   brand recall increased by 18 % after a five - second exposure when including a logo in the email . purchase likelihood also went up by a whopping 34 % in emails where logos were included .   with this in mind , add your logo to your email design to ensure that it ’s always included .   12 . name the offer in your subject line .   when you include an incentive in your subject line , you can drastically increase your open rates .   \" free shipping when you spend $ 25 or more \" and \" receive a free ipod with a demo \" are examples of good , incentive - focused subject lines .   however , be careful not to overwhelm your readers with savings- or product - related emails .   customer loyalty starts with casual industry insights – only after nurturing should you start introducing offers . here \\'s an example of an email with an enticing subject line and warm , welcoming body copy :   13 . allow recipients to subscribe to your newsletter .   you might be thinking , \" wait , if they received the email to begin with , should n\\'t they have already subscribed ? \"   usually , yes , and therefore adding a \" subscribe \" button to your email does n\\'t help those who \\'ve already agreed to receive your emails . but great content is shareable content , and if your current subscribers are forwarding your emails to their friends and colleagues , you \\'ll want to help them subscribe , too .   add a small but visible cta that allows an email viewer to subscribe to the newsletter if they received this email from someone else .   but remember , because your newsletter should already be driving another action , such as downloading an ebook or becoming a community member , make sure this \" subscribe \" button does n\\'t distract or confuse users , weakening your main campaign goal in the process .   14 . write compelling ( but concise ) subject lines .   a good subject line should contain between 30 and 50 characters , including spaces . the reason why you do this is that email providers often cut off subject lines that go beyond this length .   your email subject line should also create a sense of urgency while giving readers some indication of what to expect once they open the email .   15 . use auto - responders for opt - ins .   be prepared for your readers to forget they opted in .   set up an auto - responder that reminds people they opted into your email database . the auto - responder should be sent out one day , five days , and 10 days after the person registers .   each auto - responder email should also include additional content or bonus material to reward the reader for opting into the newsletter – or your readers might not feel they have enough incentive to actually opt - in .   16 . closely tie emails to landing pages .   your landing page should match the email in terms of headline , copy , and content . the look and feel of your landing page should also match the email as consistency goes a long way toward a customer \\'s trust .   just make sure you \\'re using tracking tools to see which emails and landing pages performed the best so you can keep sending what \\'s working .   17 . conduct a five - second test .   send a copy of the email to a friend or business associate . can they quickly tell what your call - to - action is ? if so , you \\'re golden . if not , keep working .   there are a lot of new tools at a marketer \\'s disposal that are getting attention these days . but email marketing has stood the test of time regarding its influence on your users . this old , reliable , and faithful tool can really ensure you get the most out of your marketing initiatives .   editor \\'s note : this post was originally published in june 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness .',\n",

              " '5 ideas for creating killer evergreen content [ + examples ] . just as the evergreen tree is a symbol of perpetual life , evergreen content marketing uses ideas and techniques that are sustainable and lasting over time .   these evergreen marketing campaigns transcend the latest “ buzz ” by providing long - lasting expertise that users come back to again and again .   what is evergreen content ? evergreen content discusses topics that will stay relevant amd valuable for a longer period of time with only minor updates related to data or dates .   to add a paragraph snippet , copy all of the following code into your blog post ’s html . see the comments to the right for added instruction .   we have some good examples of evergreen content below , but the gold standard are those companies who build pages that we all turn to regularly on sites like wikipedia , and imdb .   these pages have built their audiences on content that remains evergreen , in part because editors keep the information up - to - date and relevant and in part because there ’s always someone who remembers a classic movie and wants know , for example , exactly why rick came to casablanca . ( it was “ for the water ” even though casablanca is in the desert . rick was ... “ misinformed . ” )   evergreen content ideas   1 . aim for a balance of sustainability and timelessness .     there are basically two types of evergreen content : content that remains pertinent , regardless of passing time and changing culture , and content that loses relevance and importance over time if it ’s not tended to and updated to reflect changing trends and technology .   some examples of content considered evergreen are “ how to ” guides . guides on “ how to tie your shoes ” or “ how to plant a rose bush , ” for example , probably wo n’t change over the next 50 years . a guide about “ how to upload photos from your ipad to facebook ” is somewhat different .   this guide will remain “ evergreen ” as long as the information is updated to include changes made to facebook , or the ipad . both of these types of “ how to guides ” exhibit the different kinds of evergreen content : the first is perennially relevant , and the other is also relevant , as long as it is edited and looked after to reflect changes in technology .   an example from the world of business is good greens , a company that set out to revitalize the world of nutrition . while food trends come and go , good content about nutrition remains important always .   the company was started by accident , when founder keith pabley began working with a local doctor to help him grow his practice . the doctor was recommending nutrition bars to his patients , but all of them tasted terrible . keith developed bars that were good for you , and that tasted good , too .   like many small businesses , keith \\'s marketing budget was n\\'t very big . he knew he needed to do something , so he started reaching out to bloggers to help him get the word out . he incorporated a blog on his own website that included reviews from top nutrition consultants , doctors , and even celebrities . it was n\\'t long before he developed a following for good greens , and now they \\'ve grown incredibly . in fact , excellent website content helped his sales jump 50 percent in only four months \\' time .   by incorporating a blog on the site , good greens is able to keep product information relevant and up - to - date with nutritional trends . regular blogging helps bring new eyes to evergreen content .   2 . promote your evergreen content on social media .     there are certain aspects of your social media marketing that will probably not change over time . establishing your presence in social channels , paying attention to your audience , engaging with people , and responding to comments and ideas should all be forms of evergreen social marketing .   what is evergreen marketing ? evergreen marketing occurs when evergreen content is created for social media channels or is promoted on social media channels , often by a brand as part of a content marketing campaign .   social media is not only a great way to show the human side of your brand , but by sharing evergreen content with a longer shelf life , your content can be shared more often .   even though content on social networks must be engaging , it is important to remember that every business has a different target audience . an effective evergreen social campaign should focus on strategy first and execution second . one really fun example of excellence in social media content is the dollar shave club .   have you heard of this amazing startup company ? the fact is , shaving is n\\'t exciting . shaving is something that every man in a civilized society has to do , even if he only does the occasional trim . so , when the folks who started the dollar shave club got the idea for their company , they knew they had to create spectacular content that would grab the attention of their intended audience .   it was n\\'t enough just to give their company a cool name and sell razor blades for really cheap . who would pay attention to that if it was all they did ? no , instead , they went for something even better - creating amazing content .   it all started with a video . if you have n\\'t seen this video , you should really check it out . it has had well over five million views , and within the first two days of doing business , this video alone resulted in 12,000 customers for the dollar shave club . there \\'s no doubt that what they did worked , and it continues to work , because the company continues to grow .   in addition to creating other videos , they \\'ve also added an interesting blog to their website . it \\'s brand new , but in light of their other content , it \\'s sure to be worthwhile reading for old and new customers , alike . the immediate growth of the dollar shave club has earned them tremendous visibility in the media , not to mention almost 60,000 social signals .   obviously , creativity works when it comes to creating evergreen marketing content . even when your business is n\\'t the most captivating one out there , a little bit of imagination in your content can go a long way . it makes sense to push the envelope a little bit just to give people a reason to share your posts on social media . so have some fun !   3 . connect evergreen pieces with a pillar page .     many businesses fill their blogs with quality evergreen content only to see it get buried by the influx of new blog posts . you must make an effort to call out these evergreen posts so that they are immediately obvious to new visitors . you could call attention to these posts by creating a “ start ” page , training guides , or in a “ top posts ” section of your blog .   creating a page that highlights and categorizes your evergreen content can also be a helpful way to increase interlinking on your site . interlinking can positively boost your seo and search rankings and make your pages look like they have more authority to google crawlers . here \\'s a helpful blog post that gives more information about how this process works .   4 . update older evergreen pieces .   you can also use your existing blog content to squeeze out a little more forgotten evergreen content . as you perform your regular audit , update your posts , add new information , and re - post them . you can also remove the date stamp and re - share this content on your social networks . the date of the post is only important if it is a news article .   like interlinking , the process of updating old content can also be helpful for search rankings . in fact , updating content for relevance and seo is called historical optimization . you can learn more about it in this blog post .   5 . experiment with different forms of content .   chances are , your blog or website already has a supply of evergreen content that you ’ve never thought much about . some excellent examples of evergreen content include :   frequently asked questions ( faqs )   “ how to ” guides   tutorials   testimonials   industry resources   glossaries of terms and phrases   “ history of ” articles   if you do n’t have any of these elements on your site , these are a great place to start creating your own evergreen content . note , too , that evergreen information does n’t just have to be written articles . it can come in the form of videos , images , or infographics .   there ’s no doubt that evergreen content can deliver the right kind of traffic to your website or blog over the long term . here are a few tips to help you get started in creating quality evergreen content :   content is about your brand – align your content to your brand and ask yourself – “ what do i want to be known for ? ”   content should appear timeless – content should feel fresh and avoid anything that may appear “ old hat ” next year . remember that even dictionaries must be updated .   get emotional – your content must make people feel something . they need to appreciate your help and sometimes even be entertained .   do n’t worry about dates – adding a date to your article can immediately render it “ old . ”   examples of evergreen content   citrix   many of the ideas above are found in one place , the blog of citrix , the company behind gotomeeting and other tools for modern offices .   one of the reasons their blogs are so successful is because they provide excellent , helpful , accurate , and pertinent information to people who are interested in the topic .   however , what they do not do is push their products . in fact , on citrix \\'s blog , work shifting , it can even be a little hard to discover who the company is that runs the blog . but what makes this so effective as a business blog is the fact that they put the needs of the audience first in a way that helps readers with their needs and interests .   this downplaying of their involvement does not mean that their presence is n\\'t there . the distinctive visual branding is there with their logos and images . however , they avoid naming themselves repetitively . instead , they provide excellent evergreen content that is directed at helping their audience .   glacier skywalks   located in sunwapta valley , glacier skywalk is a walkway that extends out from a cliff , and it has been underway for a few months now . the attraction is scheduled to be open to the public by may 2014 .   it only takes 15 seconds of watching a video to get your heart hammering in its chest . if you \\'re not sure what the structure is going to look like , watching the video can make you think the man in the video is about ready to walk right off a cliff .   it \\'s a thrilling spectacle to see someone walking on the glass floor , and it \\'s enough to make anyone want to venture to glacier skywalk and try it out for themselves . they ’ve created interest in their product and made it evergreen material by appealing to the sense of awe and apprehensiveness we all feel about walking at the edge of a cliff .   when you visit the blog , you \\'ll see that they \\'ve included posts about the construction of the glacier skywalk , as well as information about the stunning mountain and glacial vistas . this will encourage two types of people to come back : those who are interested in the construction of what will be a long - standing technological curiosity , and those who just love nature .   glacier skywalk keeps their material evergreen by doing two things right : first , by getting emotional content on the site , content that is appealing to the sense of awe and fear we all might feel when watching the video . second , the site offers perennially relevant information on their subject , such as how the bridge is built , and by highlighting its purpose -- to show off the beautiful natural surroundings .   but they ’ll need to work to make sure the thrill does n’t get lost in the details of construction . keeping the thrilling content at the top will be a key there .   buffer   buffer \\'s blog tackles aspects of social media and online marketing . it posts primarily evergreen content with blogs that center around how - tos , tutorials , listicles , and expert tips .   although this content relates to social media , which is a fairly new trend , it tackles overarching topics and questions that marketers might have on many different platforms , such as making video ads .   on top of the blog , buffer also has a solid social media presence on many of the major social platforms . they regularly post content from their blog along with social specific content that relates to something they recently posted on their blog .   wikipedia   as mentioned above , wikipedia is an encyclopedia - styled evergreen site where anyone can add information to a person , event , or thing \\'s biography . because anyone can add , verify , and edit information , all posts are regularly updated and relevant for longer periods of time . this means that the entire site is a gold mine of evergreen content -- especially when it comes to posts or pages about historical topics .   although wikipedia primarily focuses on generating evergreen content , they also have an \" in the news \" section which allows them to mix in trendier , less - evergreen content for readers looking for a combination of both evergreen and breaking content .   why you should n\\'t forget about trendy content   creating evergreen content does n\\'t mean that your blog should never post up - to - date information , or that it always has to educate , inform , or help your audience . but blending in posts that show you recognize their needs and want to help with reliable information for today and many days and years into the future is the best way to create evergreen content that will pay off for your company .',\n",
              " \"artificial intelligence is here - people just do n’t realize it . tl;dr : artificial intelligence ( ai ) technologies are already widely used today – people just do n’t realize it . hubspot surveyed over 1,400 consumers globally about ai and found that :   63 % of people do n't realize they 're already using ai technologies .   use of voice search has seriously increased , so seo / serp professionals need to take notice .   consumers are comfortable buying from a bot that provides customized service .   people are very open to using ai - enabled bots for customer service , particularly for straightforward requests and questions .   table of contents ( 8 minute read )   ai technologies have captured the public imagination for decades ( think hal 9000 , the terminator , etc . ) , but many people do n’t realize that they are already using ai technologies every single day . perhaps it ’s because we ’ve been expecting to see a mind - blowing , sentient robot that talks and thinks like us . that may be reality in the future . but as of today , we ’re surrounded by a plethora of incredibly sophisticated artificial intelligence tools that are designed to make all facets of modern life easier . ( to get a better understanding of artificial intelligence , check out our primer that breaks down the core technologies available today . )   for marketers , salespeople , and any professionals who operate online , these artificial intelligence tools have huge potential to improve their day - to - day functions , help them become more targeted and efficient in their day jobs , and allow their businesses to uncover customer trends that were impossible to sift through in the past . the possibilities are endless . and there ’s huge appetite among the general public to use ai tools : 86 % are interested in trying them out . businesses that tap into that interest early can differentiate themselves , especially with respect to customer service . want this chart ? click to download .   this report will dive into three areas of ai technology innovation that will greatly impact the way consumers interact with businesses :   voice search   ecommerce   customer service   we ’ll end with some present - day product examples that speak to the breadth of ai ’s impact on modern life .   the steady growth of voice search   search assistants like siri , alexa , and cortana are powered by natural language processing and speech recognition programs , making them ai tools . since apple introduced siri in 2011 , voice search capabilities are available on the 3.9 billion apple , android , and windows devices worldwide . because of its ubiquity , voice search is one of the most established ai - enabled technologies today .   to get a sense of how people view ai today , our survey first focused on people ’s perception of ai . when asked , just 37 % of our respondents said they ’d used an ai tool . but , through follow - up questions , we found that 63 % of respondents who said they did n’t use ai technologies were actually using ai – they just did n't know voice search engines or programs like siri are powered by ai . thanks to simple , easy - to - use tools like voice search , ai has crept into widespread use without many realizing it .   want this chart ? click to download .   why this matters to businesses : in 2011 , when apple first released siri , many people snickered at its inability to understand seemingly simple questions and give correct answers – a reviewer for mashable wrote at the time : “ siri works just barely well enough for apple to pull it off ” . but in the years since , apple , google , microsoft , amazon , and countless other companies have released and refined their own voice - enabled ai assistants . people have noticed the improvements to siri , cortana , and alexa and have regularly begun using them .   want this chart ? click to download .   our survey revealed 74 % of all respondents have used voice search tools within the past month . we tracked daily usage of voice apps and found the rate of usage has increased a great deal just this year – since may daily use of voice search increased 27 % . why is that a big deal ? this brisk change in search behavior worldwide has huge implications for seo professionals whose job it is to make sure their business is found in the top of search results . as more people bypass the search screen by using voice search , the mechanics of search become completely different . instead of a list of search options to choose from , the voice search tool gives only one option as a result and often with no attribution to the source of the result . this has significant impact on a small and growing business ’s ability to attract people to its website and establish its brand . however , voice search also enables businesses to be more discoverable in local searches , so marketers need to set up their website and content to appear when someone seeks a local business .   want this chart ? click to download .   people are also much happier with the quality of voice search results compared to six months ago . siri was released in 2011 and over the last five years , people have learned how to ask questions to get the right result . at the same time , apple has steadily improved siri ’s accuracy via machine learning . now , the majority of people who use voice search are happy with the results .   want this chart ? click to download .   in our sample , german , british , and irish respondents were least happy with their voice search results . this is likely due to voice recognition systems having trouble deciphering regional accents and general localization issues with the technology . we expect satisfaction will trend up as engineers improve their products to better analyze different languages , dialects , and accents .   want this chart ? click to download .   consumers ’ voice search behavior will directly impact the seo priorities of b2c companies the most in the near future . that ’s because people prefer using voice search at home or in their car , where they ’re more likely to ask about personal topics rather than work - related topics . however , the taboo of asking questions out loud and in public will likely fade , just as people became accustomed to others talking on the phone via bluetooth headsets . currently , 27 % are comfortable using voice search at work , and 17 % would use voice search in public areas .   want this chart ? click to download .   ecommerce chatbots   one of the fastest growing use cases for ai technology is ecommerce capabilities integrated within chatbots . the idea is to allow people to buy items through a chatbot that can provide personalized purchase recommendations . in our survey , 47 % of respondents are open to buying items using a chatbot . want this chart ? click to download .   chatbots leverage natural language processing to communicate with a human . the chatbot processes a buyer ’s request and taps into machine learning to determine the best products or options to serve a user based on purchasing trends . if a buyer asks for snow boots , a bot can suggest the top - rated boots sold by the company . the bot can also recommend wool socks to go with the boots because it knows people who buy boots also purchase wool socks in past purchases .   in the example below , sam browses products from gosun stove , chooses the product he wants , and purchases it directly via the chatbot . using the bot , sam ’s buying experience is simple , personalized , and seamless .   over 4 billion people worldwide actively use messaging apps . chatbots typically sit natively on messaging applications , such as slack , whatsapp , line , and facebook messenger . in line with our questions on chatbots , we wanted to know how comfortable consumers are with purchasing from a social network like facebook instead of an ecommerce website . there ’s a slight barrier to entry in the mind of the consumer who typically associates facebook as a place to stay in touch with friends rather than a place to buy items . the majority of respondents do n’t see social networks as a place for purchases … yet . as social networks , especially facebook , command more of people ’s time , there will be a natural enlargement of the sphere ( see the uproar over facebook ’s foray into media , specifically video and news ) and in time , people will become more comfortable with buying from brands through social media . it turns out , 37 % would consider buying items on a social network instead of a company 's website . want this chart ? click to download .   why this matters to businesses : with an ecommerce bot powered by ai , businesses can have an always - on salesperson that can interact with customers on a one - to - many basis . on top of 24/7 availability , a sales bot exists on the world ’s most popular social networks and messaging applications , making it ubiquitous . ecommerce bots can offer personalized purchasing experiences to customers while expanding a business ’s reach . the easiest win is for b2c companies that sell consumer goods with a straightforward , repeatable selling cycle . there are many companies like springbot that build ecommerce bots for businesses , so there ’s no need for individual companies to find a developer to build a homegrown system . as machine learning programs get smarter , it ’s likely that ecommerce bots will be able to field much more complicated questions from potential buyers and help sell bigger offerings .   ai - enabled customer service   there is huge potential for businesses both big and small to leverage ai ’s natural language processing capabilities to better serve their customers and prospects . in the service sector , live chat has revolutionized service , with consumers finding it almost as preferable as live phone and email support – and hubspot believes customer service bots are the next evolution . a service bot provides the shortest path for a website visitor to get the answer he or she seeks . want this chart ? click to download .   here ’s the concept : an ai - enabled bot sitting on a business ’s website answers visitors ’ questions on demand , such as : what ’s your pricing ? what ’s your company phone number ? where is your office ? the visitor gets a direct answer instead of having to click through the website navigation to find that information . when given the scenario , 57 % of our respondents were interested in getting real - time answers from bots on a company website . this is the highest level of interest exhibited by our respondents for all of our bot scenarios across ecommerce and service . want this chart ? click to download .   beyond information bots sitting on a company website , many are comfortable using ai - enabled technologies for more involved customer service requests . when we asked respondents if they had a preference for who should help them in a service setting , 40 % did n't care if they 're helped by a person or ai tool – good news for ai service companies . the most compelling use case is for simple customer service questions , such as changing a billing address , with openness to ai increasing to 53 % . for more complicated cases that require multiple steps or involve more technical help , people prefer human assistance – in that case , openness drops to 26 % . want this chart ?

              " \"what is the average time spent on a website ? [ + how to improve it ] . according to a pew research center survey , 85 % of americans say they go online on a daily basis , with 31 % reporting that they go online “ almost constantly . ”   with people spending more time online than ever before , it ’s important that your website is optimized for visitors to browse and stick around . but longer is n’t necessarily better . you want visitors to stay on your website because they ’re enjoying the content and experience — not because they ca n’t find the information that they ’re looking for or ca n’t complete a desired action , like making a purchase .   in this post , we ’ll cover what a “ good ” average time on page and average session duration benchmark is , and how to improve these metrics on your website .   average time on page benchmark   according to contentsquare ’s 2021 digital experience benchmark report , the average time on page across all industries is 54 seconds . while you can use that as a benchmark , meeting it does n't necessarily mean your average time on page is optimal .   like page views , bounce rate , and other website metrics , average time on page is contextual . what ’s “ good ” depends on the type of website you have , the industry you ’re in , and the web page you ’re tracking , among many other factors .   for example , in their 2021 digital experience benchmark report , contentsquare analyzed data   from over 20 billion user sessions from across the globe . they were able to track average time on page across 10 industries , and found major differences .   image source   b2b , for example , had the highest average time spent on page with 1.37 minutes . this was at least 20 seconds higher than the other industries . the industries on the other end of the spectrum were grocery and energy , with an average time spent per page of 44 seconds . this gap emphasizes the importance of using an average time on page benchmark that ’s specific to your industry .   a “ good ” average time on page also depends on the type of content . for example , you ideally want visitors spending more time on your product pages and blog posts . in fact , in a survey by databox , 45 % of respondents said that the average time on page for their blog posts is 3 - 5 minutes . a higher time on page indicates that the content is relevant , easy to read and understand , and targeted at the right audience .   on landing and checkout pages , however , higher time on page could mean that there are obstacles to conversion . the content , ctas , or form might be confusing , for example .   average time on page google analytics   google analytics is one of the most widely used tools to measure average time on page , among other performance metrics . it ’s therefore important to explain how google analytics calculates this metric .   google analytics tracks average time on page by measuring the difference between the timestamps of hits . that means if a user lands on a web page and then closes their browser window or tab , or types another url into their address bar , their visit is not counted .   so average time on page is calculated from the non - exits and non - bounces only , which is a smaller percentage than the total hits for a page .   that ’s why this average is typically higher than average session duration , which we ’ll talk about more in the next section .   google analytics also keeps tracking time on page even if the user ’s browser window or tab is hidden . so while this metric is not the most accurate , it is still a valuable indicator of how engaging and effective your content is .   now that we have a better understanding of how to calculate and benchmark the average amount of time users spend on individual pages , let ’s take a look at how to figure out how long visitors are spending on your entire website .   average time spent on a website   average time spent on a website , like average time on page , is dependent on a range of factors . industry , the type of website , and even the device that users are on impact this average .   for example , statista calculated the 20 most popular websites worldwide as of june 2021 , by time per visit . users spent approximately 22 minutes and 44 seconds per visit on google , the most popular website , and only .54 minutes on vk.com , the 20th most popular .   to calculate how long visitors are staying on average on your entire website instead of individual web pages , look at average session duration .   average session duration measures the average length of sessions on a website . google analytics begins counting the length of a session from the time the user lands on a site until the user exits the site , or is inactive for a predetermined amount of time . ( in google analytics , a session can last for up to 30 minutes without a user interacting with your pages . )   that means a session can consist of a user viewing a single page or viewing multiple pages , and can range anywhere from a few seconds to a few hours .   average session duration is calculated as : total duration of all sessions ( in seconds ) / number of sessions .   this is a key difference between average time on page and average session duration . whereas average time on page excludes visits that end in exits or bounces , average session duration counts all bounces as zero seconds . this can lower the average session duration significantly if your website has a high bounce rate .   the google analytics dashboard below , for example , is tracking the same website as above . so while its average time on page last week was 14 minutes and 50 seconds , its average session duration was 1 minute and 37 seconds .   to improve average session duration , or the average time spent on a website , try the best practices below .   how to improve average time spent on a website decrease load time . optimize your navigation . add internal links . improve the readability of your posts . add images and videos . optimize for all devices . use exit intent popups .   1 . decrease load time .   decreasing load time can help reduce your site ’s bounce rate , which can significantly improve average session duration .   in a study commissioned by google and conducted by 55 and deloitte , decreasing mobile site load times by just one tenth of a second resulted in significant decreases in bounce rate : 0.6 % for homepages , 5.7 % for product listing pages , and 1.9 % for product details pages .   using a cdn , optimizing images , reducing redirects , and compressing files are just a few ways to decrease load time . to learn more , check out our full guide on optimizing your website speed .   2 . optimize your navigation .   website navigation enables visitors to quickly and easily find the information they 're looking for , like a blog post , and important information that they were n’t looking for , like pricing info . a good navigation system can improve the chances of visitors taking action and browsing your site longer .   when designing a navigation menu , follow these best practices :   put your most important items at the beginning of the navigation menu .   use navigation labels that align with your type of business and are seo - optimized .   include a search box .   add navigation links in the header , sidebar , and footer of your site .   3 . add internal links .   another way to enable visitors to easily find and read relevant content on your site is adding internal links . internal linking makes your site easier to navigate , which increases the chances that readers look at more content and stay on your site longer .   here ’s an example of a blog post with lots of internal links encouraging visitors to dive into these subtopics in more depth :   image source   4 . improve the readability of your posts .   when evaluating the readability of your content , you need to consider what the words are on the page and how they look .   to improve the flow of the post , remove any instances of passive voice , shorten long sentences or paragraphs , and add transition words . to improve the look of the post , try adding headings , subheadings , and bullet points to break up chunks of texts . also make sure you ’re using an easy - to - read font and accessible color scheme .   a tool like yoast seo can help automate this process . in fact , it has a readability analysis tab where it provides actionable feedback to make your post or page easier to read .   image source   5 . add images and videos .   adding multimedia content , like images , videos , and infographics , is another way to improve the readability of your content . not only do they break up chunks of text — they can also illustrate complicated ideas ( like apis , for example ) and appeal to different types of learners .   image source   images and videos enhance the overall user experience and encourage visitors to stay on the page longer .   6 . optimize for all devices .   according to a study by perficient , 68.1 % of all website visits globally in 2020 came from mobile devices and only 28.9 % and 3.1 % came from desktops and tablets , respectively . however , desktops drove 46.4 % of total time on site globally and tablets drove more total time on site than mobile devices .   this emphasizes the importance of having a fully responsive website that ’s optimized for all devices . sizing and styling buttons , svgs , images , and fonts are especially important when creating a responsive site . for more best practices , check out our complete guide to responsive web design .   7 . use exit intent popups .   exit intent popups appear when a visitor is about to bounce from a website . these contain an offer or message that ’s designed to keep them on the page . briogeo , for example , has an exit intent popup encouraging visitors to take their hair quiz before leaving the site .   image source   while this wo n’t convince every visitor to stay , it may convince some , which will ultimately help improve your average session duration .   encouraging visitors to stay on your site   average time on page and average session duration are excellent indicators of how engaging and effective your content is and whether you ’re attracting quality traffic . now that you understand what these metrics mean and what benchmarks to use to evaluate your performance , you can focus on optimizing your site to have visitors browse for longer .   editor 's note : this post was originally published in march 2014 and has been updated for comprehensiveness .\",\n",

              " 'the beginner \\'s guide to conversational marketing . everything you need to know to connect with your audience how , when , and where they want .   1 . domino \\'s pizza   domino \\'s recent domino \\'s anyware initiative allows customers to order pizza from , well , literally anywhere . this includes conversational channels like slack , facebook messenger , twitter , and text message — by simply texting the pizza emoji .   source   customers must first enable text ordering and set up an \" easy order \" on their domino \\'s profile , which is what they \\'ll order when texting 🍕 . beyond that , however , ordering a pizza does n\\'t get much simpler .   2 . hubspot   hubspot allowed people to register for its four days of facebook campaign through multiple channels , including facebook messenger . users loved the conversational ui and were quick to encourage their friends and coworkers to sign up as well .   and success was n’t just about getting people to register for the live event . facebook messenger was the highest converting source of new product users to hubspot marketing free via the campaign .   3 . london & company   london & company walks prospective mortgage customers through their mortgage finder form . but instead of a lengthy form with multiple fields , london & company displays a chatbot/ messenger format with one question at a time .   source   this conversational format is user - friendly and easy to navigate , which likely helps london & company collect information from and convert potential new leads .   4 . hellofresh   hellofresh , a subscription meal service , launched their freddy freshbot chatbot in 2017 . customers can chat with freddy through facebook messenger .   source   freddy provides customer service , recipe ideas , answers to frequently asked questions , and meal reminders . with freddy freshbot , hellofresh does a great job providing support well beyond the order and delivery process , ensuring its customers feel comfortable cooking its meals and eventually renewing their subscriptions .   5 . sephora   sephora used kik messenger to learn more about their target market by asking them if they wanted to participate in a quick , social - like quiz about their beauty habits . once users accepted , they answered questions about their age , makeup preferences , and favorite products . from there , the app was able to deliver relevant content such as how - to videos and product reviews based on the individual ’s answers .   a chatbot makes it easier for customers to find and purchase products they like and frees up human employees for other tasks .   source   conversational marketing and inbound marketing   at this point , you \\'ve probably noticed the similarities between the core ideas behind conversational marketing and inbound marketing . that ’s because conversational marketing is a piece of inbound marketing , just like email marketing or blogging . inbound marketing is all about creating value where your target customer is spending their time — that could mean writing a blog , interacting on social media , or sharing a video on youtube . now that technology has made conversational marketing a possibility , it ’s a key part of inbound marketing .   hubspot co - founder dharmesh shah states ,   \" conversation marketing is not new . not only have we long been having conversations with customers — even the term itself has been around for at least a decade . the reason for the renewed interest in conversational marketing is that because of advances in technology and shifts in consumer behavior , conversational marketing can now happen at scale . we can have direct , one - to - one conversations with individual customers on their timeline — not ours . \"   although conversations are nothing new , our ability to have 1:1 conversations at this scale and across multiple channels is . with inbound marketing , you can first attract potential customers to your brand . you can then use conversational marketing to allow people to initiate conversations when they want , where they want , and how they want – giving your audience the control .   how do conversations fit into the inbound methodology ? well , we see conversations taking place throughout the entire customer lifecycle , though there ’s not a strong case to be made for it in the attract stage as the discovery of brands on messaging platforms is still immature .   facebook messenger ’s discover tab , which launched mid-2017 , is one attempt at solving this . but conversations can be used in place of forms to attract and capture leads , by sales teams to convert those leads into customers , and by customer success teams to delight customers with quick and convenient support . for example , using live chat during the sales process could help convert more leads because it allows prospects to interact in a way they already prefer to buy .   how conversational marketing will grow your business   okay , we know conversational marketing is all about improving 1:1 relationships , but how can businesses actually start to build out a strategy for success ? cirillo recommends starting with one goal and then working backward .   \" know what you want to get out of the conversation and what data you need to make that happen . every conversation should add value to your business . \"   analyze your answers and work to create the best possible experience for your customers . while there are many things you can do to help optimize your conversations , here are a few essentials :   your crm and conversational marketing   when you have a conversation with a friend , you do n\\'t expect to have to remind them of things like your name or where you live — the same holds true when customers have conversations with a business . that \\'s why using a crm is so important . a crm is like a digital memory that allows you to have conversations with customers like you know them .   a successful conversational marketing strategy is dependent on fast and reliable access to a shared knowledge base that includes data such as communication history and necessary customer information . companies who want to do conversational marketing will need a way to store and organize that data in order to have more seamless interactions with customers . with the help of a crm , you can organically promote events and products , distribute content , and provide support all through chat .   so , what data should marketers collect ? you do n\\'t need to know everything about them , but you should know the basics and details of past conversations . cirillo encourages marketers to think first about why they \\'re using chat :   \" success with conversational marketing will look different depending on the use case . there \\'s not an overarching metric for this world . track the \\' time to solution \\' or conversion rate if you \\'re solving for utility . if your experience is less about a particular action , then retention might make more sense . ”   start with what you want your customers to be able to accomplish via chat and then build out processes for acquiring the necessary information .   in addition , you ca n’t implement a conversational marketing strategy without a process for tracking performance , moments of confusion or drop - off , and new questions . you should always be gathering data and optimizing the experience .   adding automation with chatbots   once your crm is set up , it \\'s time to think to think about how you can scale your conversations . this is where chatbots can help .   business is n’t just happening in one city , in one state , or in one timezone — it ’s happening all around the world , every minute of every day . as i mentioned earlier , adding automation with chatbots is crucial in keeping up with a volume of conversations and to have a fighting chance at 24/7 support . bots allow smbs to compete with enterprise - sized businesses .   customers expect to be able to connect with businesses whenever they need to . according to research from aspect software , 65 % of consumers feel good about themselves and the company when they can handle an issue without talking to a live person , and 61 % think that chatbots allow for faster answers .   here are few ways chatbots can help :   answer faqs or customer - specific questions where data is already available   qualify leads   promote events , products , and content   schedule meetings   get feedback from customers and prospects   keep in mind that while chatbots can do many things , they should never be used as a barrier between customers and a human . 86 % of consumers want the option to transfer to a representative if their request is too complicated for a bot to handle . bots ca n\\'t replace human talent , but they can help augment teams during off - hours or when conversation volume is too much for a small group to handle .   learn how to build the fundamentals of your conversational marketing strategy .   an inbound approach to conversations   developing a conversational marketing strategy can take time – it \\'s not easy to think about process when you \\'re trying to keep up with the day - to - day demands of running a business . that \\'s why hubspot \\'s brian bagdasarian created some tips for building a conversational marketing strategy . conversational marketing is n\\'t something you can set and forget , you have to continuously optimize your strategy to see the best results , but there are five things you should keep in mind : personalize , c ontextualize , standardize , empathize , and optimize   personalize   when speaking with a customer or prospect , conversations should be personalized with relevant shared knowledge . shared knowledge is the foundation of good conversations . think about it : if you ’ve already given a business you ’re phone number , do you really want to waste time reciting it every time you have a simple question ? personalized details make the conversation feel more natural and help you to get to the root of the issue as quickly as possible .   contextualize   conversations that have context not only improve the end - user experience , they also help minimize misunderstandings and get straight to the heart of the issue . because you do n’t have to waste time collecting information you already have access to , you ’re able to provide immediate value . context is necessary to help answer the right question , at the right time , in the best way possible .   conversations that aim to answer the most important question first will provide the best user experience . even though it \\'s a conversation , this is n\\'t like a conversation with friends . when customers interact with your business , chances are they do n\\'t want to spend time talking about cat videos or their weekend plans . they want to solve their most immediate need in the fastest and easiest way possible . spend time analyzing your interactions to determine what data will help improve your customer relationships .   standardize   however , it \\'s important not to get too caught up in personalizing your messages . while personalization and contextualization are important , standardizing elements of conversations helps bring a level of professionalism and consistency to your business . conversations should be repeatable and predictable .   figure out your customer \\'s most frequently asked questions and draft approved answers for bots and marketers to use . repeating conversations will help automate , optimize , and improve future interactions . predictable conversations help to users have a natural dialog with a clear beginning , middle , and end . standardization is crucial to delivering clear , consistent answers , across conversations and users .   empathize   when involved in a conversation , we often have to deliver the right answer before correcting the problem . for example : let ’s say you receive an email with a coupon code from one of your favorite stores . you spend a half hour scrolling through their products trying to decide what to buy , but when you finally enter the code to make your purchase , it does n’t work .   you ’re understandably annoyed that you wasted all that time when you were n’t even planning on buying something without that code . the business should emphasize with your issue and assure you that they understand the problem before the can move forward with providing a solution . emphasizing helps customers feel valued and heard .   optimize   finally , it \\'s crucial to optimize . learn from your past conversations so you can improve them in the future . optimize for the strengths of the channel and for the answer – aim to provide answers that people would receive in a real , one - to - one conversation .   for example , live chat or phone might be better for providing support , while facebook messenger could be a better choice for content delivery . listen to your customers and observe their behavior as you build out your strategy and make changes where needed . conversational marketing is an iterative process — what you thought might work may not always provide the best experience . take time to ask your customers for feedback . their advice will help you delight your next customer . remember , every conversation should be impactful and help add value to your business .   moving forward : why conversations are the future   phew , you made it to the end . good convo guys .   we \\'ve come a long way from letters and telegrams . for the first time , people are having meaningful conversations with businesses on a massive scale thanks to automation with bots , a crm , and new channels . conversational marketing is changing the way companies talk with their customers by making interactions seamless and faster than ever before . your customers are having conversations . why not join in ?   the most important things to focus on are the channel , the conversation , and how the strategy fits in with your overall inbound marketing strategy . channels should be simple for businesses and consumers to use , conversations should follow a clear process and serve a purpose , and your inbound marketing strategy should inform your conversational marketing strategy .   remember , humans have been having conversations since the beginning of time . technology is only making it easier and more productive for businesses and their customers to connect . while the days of communicating by the pony express may be over , thoughtful , friendly conversations ( and gossip ) will continue to stand the test of time and technology .   editor \\'s note : this post was originally published in august 2018 and has been updated for comprehensiveness .',\n",
              " '10 helpful tips for choosing and using fonts . when you think of all the things that make up a good design , what elements come to mind ? color ? layout ? photography ?   most people often forget that typography plays a crucial role in the success of a new design . with so many choices , choosing the \" right \" one can feel overwhelming . but the good thing about fonts is that a little bit of knowledge goes a long way .   if you \\'re not familiar with the basics of choosing and tweaking fonts to enhance a design , keep on reading . below are my 10 favorite font tips . these skills are all actionable -- so it \\'ll be easy to try them in your next social media or marketing campaign .   1 ) break your text up into separate text boxes .   when people are first starting out in design , they often use one text box on their page that has the same font and spacing throughout . however , uniform fonts and spacing certainly does n’t capture a viewer \\'s attention .   instead , try splitting your text out into separate text boxes . you ’ll be able to have a lot more fun as it \\'ll be easier to experiment with fonts , sizes , and colors .   2 ) think about the positioning and alignment of your fonts .   when you are placing your text in your designs , ensure all of the text boxes have the same alignment . generally the choice is between : left alignment , center alignment , and right alignment .   lululemon athletica has demonstrated two different options on their facebook page . in the first example above , a cover image for a blog article , the text is left aligned . in the second example it ’s center aligned . in both of these examples the text has been positioned to suit the background image spacing -- which is an important factor in determining how to place your text .   3 ) match the font style to your brand \\'s character .   selecting the right font for your design or brand should be done carefully and thoughtfully . keep in mind that a font should embody the character and spirit of your brand , as demonstrated in these examples . see how benefit cosmetics use a feminine script font on their facebook graphic , compared to lynx ’s more masculine geometric font ?   4 ) make sure your text is easy to read .   it ’s important to ensure that your font is readable , especially if you ’re using it for longer bodies of text ( like in presentations , pitch decks , and infographics ) . avoid using elaborate script fonts or uppercase text in large bodies of text as it forces strain on the reader ’s eye and makes the overall text much harder to read . see what i mean ?   5 ) play with different font sizes .   using different font sizes in your designs will help create hierarchy -- the order in which text is read . the eye is naturally drawn to large or dominant elements , so choose the largest font size for your title , followed by your subtitle , then your body text .   6 ) experiment with all caps .   when starting out in design , most people opt to always use sentence case . however , for small amounts of text -- especially your title or subtitle , all caps ( capital letters for every letter in the word ) , can be very effective for a strong , modern look .   nike use this technique effectively on its facebook page to create emphasis for its banner image and call - to - action style graphics .   7 ) try playing with letter spacing .   letter spacing , also known as tracking , is just that -- the space between letters in words . this can be increased or decreased manually in canva . increasing your letter spacing will help your type breathe , while decreasing it will tighten your type .   letter spacing is also a great way to make different lines of text the same width . see how this has applied in the example below -- the symmetrical line length creates a more balanced feel to the graphic .   8) experiment with different font pairs .   choosing fonts that complement each other is an essential design skill . when used together , different fonts create different effects . for example , the graphic below combines a decorative script font ( ‘ sunshine ’ ) with a geometric sans - serif font ( ‘ the bright side ’ ) , which balance each other out nicely . this is a jazzier font pair , which is great for social media designs .   it ’s a good rule of thumb to choose font pairs with high contrast . take another example -- a tall and short font pair . tall fonts have a strong condensed nature , which creates a great basis for contrast with the shorter , more spacious font .   9 ) make sure you place your text where it can be easily read .   clear , open areas that are great for placing text are referred to as copy space . if you ’re working with images that have a lot of copy space , your text will pop in these empty areas . see here how havaiana has created eye - catching designs for its facebook page by placing text in copy space :   10 ) reduce the quantity of text .   when you are designing , it is just as important to think about what you are saying as how it laid out on the page . can you reduce the amount of words and say the same thing more succinctly ? could a concept be displayed as an image or diagram instead of a paragraph of text ?   design is n’t just about how it looks , but how you communicate . this graphic uses a visual element , the twitter icon , to replace the need for more text saying \" on twitter . \" when you are putting your design together , continuously examine if you could articulate a concept more clearly with icons , images , and photographs instead of text .   putting these tips into action   fonts play a critical part in almost all designs -- from facebook marketing graphics to album covers for artists . do n’t be afraid to give these tips a go yourself . they ’ll help you create designs you can proudly share with the world -- even if you have n’t had any prior design experience .   with some basic design knowledge and a willingness to try , you ’ll be amazed at how a clever application of fonts can improve your marketing and branding graphics .',\n",
              " 'how to do keyword research for seo : a beginner \\'s guide . while google keeps us on our toes with all the algorithm updates they keep rollin \\' out , one thing has stayed pretty consistent for inbound marketers looking to optimize their websites for search : keyword research .   in this post , we ’ll define what keyword research is , why it ’s important , how to conduct your research for your seo strategy , and choose the right keywords for your website .   what is keyword research ? keyword research is the process of finding and analyzing search terms that people enter into search engines with the goal of using that data for a specific purpose , often for search engine optimization ( seo ) or general marketing . keyword research can uncover queries to target , the popularity of these queries , their ranking difficulty , and more .   why is keyword research important ?   keyword research helps you find which keywords are best to target and provides valuable insight into the queries that your target audience is actually searching on google . the insight that you can get into these actual search terms can help inform content strategy as well as your larger marketing strategy .   people use keywords to find solutions when conducting research online . so if your content is successful in getting in front of our audience as they conduct searches , you stand to gain more traffic . therefore , you should be targeting those searches .   in addition , in the inbound methodology , we do n\\'t create content around what we want to tell people ; we should be creating content around what people want to discover . in other words , our audience is coming to us .   this all starts with keyword research .   for an inside look into how arel=\"noopener \" target=\"_blank \" hrefs can aid you in your seo keyword research , check out our case study and exclusive interview here .   conducting keyword research has many benefits , the most popular reasons being :   marketing trend insight   conducting effective keyword research can provide you with insights into current marketing trends , and help you center your content on relevant topics and keywords your audience is in search of .   traffic growth   when you identify the best fitting keywords for the content you publish , the higher you \\'ll rank in search engine results — the more traffic you ’ll attract to your website .   customer acquisition   if your business has content that other business professionals are looking for , you can meet their needs and provide them with a call to action that will lead them into the buyer journey from the awareness stage to the point of purchase .   by researching keywords for their popularity , search volume , and general intent , you can tackle the questions that most people in your audience want answers to .   keywords vs. topics   more and more , we hear how much seo has evolved over just the last 10 years , and how unimportant keywords themselves have become to our ability to rank well for the searches people make every day .   and to some extent , this is true , but in the eyes of an seo professional it ’s a different approach . rather , it \\'s the intent behind that keyword , and whether or not a piece of content solves for that intent ( we \\'ll talk more about intent in just a minute ) .   but that does n\\'t mean keyword research is an outdated process . let me explain :   keyword research tells you what topics people care about and , assuming you use the right seo tool , how popular those topics actually are among your audience . the operative term here is topics — by researching keywords that are getting a high volume of searches per month , you can identify and sort your content into topics that you want to create content on . then , you can use these topics to dictate which keywords you look for and target .   elements of keyword research   there are three main elements to pay attention to when conducting keyword research .   1 . relevance   google ranks content for relevance . this is where the concept of search intent comes in . your content will only rank for a keyword if it meets the searchers \\' needs . in addition , your content must be the best resource out there for the query . after all , why would google rank your content higher if it provides less value than other content that exists on the web ?   2 . authority   google will provide more weight to sources it deems authoritative . that means you must do all you can to become an authoritative source by enriching your site with helpful , information content and promoting that content to earn social signals and backlinks . if you \\'re not seen as authoritative in the space , or if a keyword \\'s serps are loaded with heavy sources you ca n\\'t compete with ( like forbes or the mayo clinic ) , you have a lower chance of ranking unless your content is exceptional .   3 . volume   you may end up ranking on the first page for a specific keyword , but if no one ever searches for it , it will not result in traffic to your site . kind of like setting up shop in a ghost town .   volume is measured by msv ( monthly search volume ) , which means the number of times the keyword is searched per month across all audiences .   how to research keywords for your seo strategy   i \\'m going to lay out a keyword research process you can follow to help you come up with a list of terms you should be targeting . that way , you \\'ll be able to establish and execute a strong keyword strategy that helps you get found for the search terms you actually care about .   step 1 : make a list of important , relevant topics based on what you know about your business .   to kick off this process , think about the topics you want to rank for in terms of generic buckets . you \\'ll come up with about 5 - 10 topic buckets you think are important to your business , and then you \\'ll use those topic buckets to help come up with some specific keywords later in the process .   if you \\'re a regular blogger , these are probably the topics you blog about most frequently . or perhaps they \\'re the topics that come up the most in sales conversations . put yourself in the shoes of your buyer personas — what types of topics would your target audience search that you \\'d want your business to get found for ? if you were a company like hubspot , for example — selling marketing software ( which happens to have some awesome seo tools ... but i digress ) , you might have general topic buckets like :   \" inbound marketing \" ( 21 k )   \" blogging \" ( 19 k )   \" email marketing \" ( 30 k )   \" lead generation \" ( 17 k )   \" seo \" ( 214 k )   \" social media marketing \" ( 71 k )   \" marketing analytics \" ( 6.2 k )   \" marketing automation \" ( 8.5 k )   see those numbers in parentheses to the right of each keyword ? that \\'s their monthly search volume . this data allows you to gauge how important these topics are to your audience , and how many different sub - topics you might need to create content on to be successful with that keyword . to learn more about these sub - topics , we move on to step 2 ...   step 2 : fill in those topic buckets with keywords .   now that you have a few topic buckets you want to focus on , it \\'s time to identify some keywords that fall into those buckets . these are keyword phrases you think are important to rank for in the serps ( search engine results pages ) because your target customer is probably conducting searches for those specific terms .   for instance , if i took that last topic bucket for an inbound marketing software company — \" marketing automation \" — i \\'d brainstorm some keyword phrases that i think people would type in related to that topic . those might include :   marketing automation tools   how to use marketing automation software   what is marketing automation ?   how to tell if i need marketing automation software   lead nurturing   email marketing automation   top automation tools   and so on and so on . the point of this step is n\\'t to come up with your final list of keyword phrases . you just want to end up with a brain dump of phrases you think potential customers might use to search for content related to that particular topic bucket . we \\'ll narrow the lists down later in the process so you do n\\'t have something too unwieldy .   although more and more keywords are getting encrypted by google every day , another smart way to come up with keyword ideas is to figure out which keywords your website is already getting found for . to do this , you \\'ll need website analytics software like google analytics or hubspot \\'s sources report , available in the traffic analytics tool . drill down into your website \\'s traffic sources , and sift through your organic search traffic bucket to identify the keywords people are using to arrive at your site .   repeat this exercise for as many topic buckets as you have . and remember , if you \\'re having trouble coming up with relevant search terms , you can always head on over to your customer - facing colleagues — those who are in sales or service and ask them what types of terms their prospects and customers use , or common questions they have . those are often great starting points for keyword research .   here at hubspot , we use the search insights report in this part of the process . this template is designed to help you do the same and bucket your keywords into topic clusters , analyze msv , and inform your editorial calendar and strategy .   featured resource : search insights report template   download the template   step 3 : understand how intent affects keyword research and analyze accordingly .   like i said in the previous section , user intent is now one of the most pivotal factors in your ability to rank well on search engines like google . today , it \\'s more important that your web page addresses the problem a searcher intended to solve than simply carries the keyword the searcher used . so , how does this affect the keyword research you do ?   it \\'s easy to take keywords for face value , and unfortunately , keywords can have many different meanings beneath the surface . because the intent behind a search is so important to your ranking potential , you need to be extra - careful about how you interpret the keywords you target .   let \\'s say , for example , you \\'re researching the keyword \" how to start a blog \" for an article you want to create . \" blog \" can mean a blog post or the blog website itself , and what a searcher \\'s intent is behind that keyword will influence the direction of your article . does the searcher want to learn how to start an individual blog post ? or do they want to know how to actually launch a website domain for the purposes of blogging ? if your content strategy is only targeting people interested in the latter , you \\'ll need to make sure of the keyword \\'s intent before committing to it .   to verify what a user \\'s intent is in a keyword , it \\'s a good idea to simply enter this keyword into a search engine yourself , and see what types of results come up . make sure the type of content google is closely related to what you \\'d intend to create for the keyword .   step 4 : research related search terms .   this is a creative step you may have already thought of when doing keyword research . if not , it \\'s a great way to fill out those lists .   if you \\'re struggling to think of more keywords people might be searching about a specific topic , take a look at the related search terms that appear when you plug in a keyword into google . when you type in your phrase and scroll to the bottom of google \\'s results , you \\'ll notice some suggestions for searches related to your original input . these keywords can spark ideas for other keywords you may want to take into consideration .   want a bonus ? type in some of those related search terms and look at their related search terms .   step 5 : use keyword research tools to your advantage .   keyword research and seo tools can help you come up with more keyword ideas based on exact match keywords and phrase match keywords based on the ideas you \\'ve generated up to this point . some of the most popular ones include :   fill out the form to access your kit . complete seo starter pack featured resource   how to find and choose keywords for your website   once you have an idea of the keywords that you want to rank for , now it \\'s time to refine your list based on the best ones for your strategy . here \\'s how :   step 1 . use google keyword planner to cut down your keyword list .   in google ’s keyword planner , you can get search volume and traffic estimates for keywords you \\'re considering . then , take the information you learn from keyword planner and use google trends to fill in some blanks .   use the keyword planner to flag any terms on your list that have way too little ( or way too much ) search volume , and do n\\'t help you maintain a healthy mix like we talked about above . but before you delete anything , check out their trend history and projections in google trends . you can see whether , say , some low - volume terms might actually be something you should invest in now — and reap the benefits for later .   or perhaps you \\'re just looking at a list of terms that is way too unwieldy , and you have to narrow it down somehow ... google trends can help you determine which terms are trending upward , and are therefore worth more of your focus .   step 2 : prioritize low - hanging fruit .   what we mean by prioritizing low - hanging fruit is to prioritize keywords that you have a chance of ranking for based on your website ’s authority .   large companies typically go after high search volume keywords , and since these brands are well established already , google typically rewards them with authority over many topics .   you can also consider keywords that have little competition . keywords that do n’t already have multiple articles battling for the highest rank can afford you the spot by default — if there ’s no one else trying to claim it .   step 3 : check the monthly search volume ( msv ) for keywords you ’ve chosen .   you want to write content around what people want to discover , and checking msv can help you do just that .   monthly search volume is the number of times a search query or keyword is entered into search engines each monthly . tools like searchvolume.io or google trends can help you find out the most searched keywords over related keyword clusters for free .   step 4 : factor in serp features as you choose keywords .   there ’s several serp feature snippets that google will highlight if used correctly . an easy way to find out about them is to look up the keywords of your choosing and see what the first result looks like . but for a quick overview of the types of serp featured snippets , we ’ll summarize what they are here .   image packs   image packs are search results displayed as a horizontal row of images that appear in an organic position . if there ’s an image pack , you should write an image - heavy post to win placement in it .   paragraph snippets   featured snippets , or paragraph snippets , are short snippets of text that appear at the top of google search results for quick answers to common search queries . understanding the searcher ’s intent and providing succinct , concise answers can help in winning the placement .   list snippets   list snippets , or listicles , are snippets made for posts outlining steps to do something from start to finish — often for “ how to ” searches . making posts with direct , clear instructions and formatting can assist in winning this placement .   video snippets   video snippets are short videos that google will display at the top of a search query page in place of text featured snippets . posting a video on both youtube and your website can help you win this placement if tagged in the targeted keywords people are searching for .   step 5 : check for a mix of head terms and long - tail keywords in each bucket .   head terms are keyword phrases that are generally shorter and more generic — they \\'re typically just one to three words in length , depending on who you talk to . long - tail keywords , on the other hand , are longer keyword phrases usually containing three or more words .   it \\'s important to check that you have a mix of head terms and long - tail terms because it \\'ll give you a keyword strategy that \\'s well balanced with long - term goals and short - term wins . that \\'s because head terms are generally searched more frequently , making them often ( not always , but often ) much more competitive and harder to rank for than long - tail terms . think about it : without even looking up search volume or difficulty , which of the following terms do you think would be harder to rank for ?   how to write a great blog post blogging   if you answered # 2 , you \\'re absolutely right . but do n\\'t get discouraged . while head terms generally boast the most search volume ( meaning greater potential to send you traffic ) , frankly , the traffic you \\'ll get from the term \" how to write a great blog post \" is usually more desirable .   why ?   because someone who is looking for something that specific is probably a much more qualified searcher for your product or service ( presuming you \\'re in the blogging space ) than someone looking for something really generic . and because long - tail keywords tend to be more specific , it \\'s usually easier to tell what people who search for those keywords are really looking for . someone searching for the head term \" blogging , \" on the other hand , could be searching it for a whole host of reasons unrelated to your business .   so check your keyword lists to make sure you have a healthy mix of head terms and long - tail keywords . you definitely want some quick wins that long - tail keywords will afford you , but you should also try to chip away at more difficult head terms over the long haul .   step 6 : see how competitors are ranking for these keywords .   just because your competitor is doing something does n’t mean you need to . the same goes for keywords . just because a keyword is important to your competitor , does n’t mean it \\'s important to you . however , understanding what keywords your competitors are trying to rank for is a great way to help you give your list of keywords another evaluation .   if your competitor is ranking for certain keywords that are on your list , too , it definitely makes sense to work on improving your ranking for those . however , do n’t ignore the ones your competitors do n’t seem to care about . this could be a great opportunity for you to own market share on important terms , too .   understanding the balance of terms that might be a little more difficult due to competition , versus those terms that are a little more realistic , will help you maintain a similar balance that the mix of long - tail and head terms allows . remember , the goal is to end up with a list of keywords that provide some quick wins but also helps you make progress toward bigger , more challenging seo goals .   how do you figure out what keywords your competitors are ranking for , you ask ? aside from manually searching for keywords in an incognito browser and seeing what positions your competitors are in , arel=\"noopener \" target=\"_blank \" hrefs allows you to run a number of free reports that show you the top keywords for the domain you enter . this is a quick way to get a sense of the types of terms your competitors are ranking for .   best keywords for seo   understand that there \\'s no \" best \" keywords , just those that are highly searched by your audience . with this in mind , it \\'s up to you to craft a strategy that will help you rank pages and drive traffic .   the best keywords for your seo strategy will take into account relevance , authority , and volume . you want to find highly searched keywords that you can reasonably compete for based on :   the level of competition you \\'re up against . your ability to produce content that exceeds in quality what \\'s currently ranking .   and you ’ve got the right keywords for your website seo   you now have a list of keywords that \\'ll help you focus on the right topics for your business , and get you some short - term and long - term gains .   be sure to re - evaluate these keywords every few months — once a quarter is a good benchmark , but some businesses like to do it even more often than that . as you gain even more authority in the serps , you \\'ll find that you can add more and more keywords to your lists to tackle as you work on maintaining your current presence , and then growing in new areas on top of that .   editor \\'s note : this post was originally published in may 2019 and has been updated for comprehensiveness .',\n",

did it carry a more conversational tone ? consider these questions as you build out your keywords and content in the future .   2 ) keywords designated to your top 10 blog posts   determine what your top 10 most viewed blog posts are , then look at which keywords were associated with this content . gather these results and feed them into a keyword planning tool .   there are a few free options out there , but using the google keyword planning tool always does the trick for us . type in your keyword , check out the results , and look for long - tail keywords that spring from the suggestions . long - tail key terms are becoming invaluable as google begins catering to more natural , conversational search queries .   3 ) site search bar   adding a search bar to your blog or website provides two bonuses -- if someone is using a search bar on your site , it means they ’re spending time on your website looking for more content , and the terms they search for will be provided .   if you ’ve put thought into your content strategy , then you 're consciously targeting your ideal customers . as they begin using your search bar , you ’ll get a closer look at what they expect to find from your content and may get more insight into their pain points . using google analytics , you ’ll be able to track search queries from your website much like you would have from google ’s search tool before .   from these results , you may find a related topic that you ’ve yet to cover -- that ’s the perfect opportunity to build more content and provide your viewers with -- quite literally -- what they are asking for . keep in mind , however , that this resource involves an additional fee , so may not be the most cost - effective option for your business .   4 ) in - depth persona research   no campaign is complete without first identifying who the target audience is . by clearly defining your buyer personas , you 'll be taking a more preemptive strike to provide your viewers with what they need before they even ask . study your personas . ask yourself what their needs are . what are their pain points ? where do they find their information ? what do you provide that aligns the most with their lifestyle ?   i 'm certain that as you delve further into your buyer persona research , you 'll not only find valuable information about your customers , but you 'll unearth new vocabulary terms that they might be using in search , as well .   5 ) online industry forums     many industries encourage the use of online forums where like - minded individuals contribute and generate conversation . these are playgrounds for valuable keywords that you may not have thought of on your own .   plug the url of a related industry forum into the google keyword planning tool ; this will grab hundreds of the terms that people use and talk about on a daily basis , and produce them in a simple - to - use excel file . comb through this list for long - tail phrases that are relevant to your business . you might find that this list will also give you ideas for blog posts and premium content offers !   6 ) google ’s related search and suggestions tools   if you have an idea of what your keyword should be , type it into google -- scroll to the bottom and you ’ll see google ’s “ related searches . ” this provides you with variations on that term so you can see other search queries that viewers may have used to find a similar topic . one of these related searches may be more relevant , or may provide a more long - tail approach .   similarly , you might see “ google suggestions ” as you type into the search bar . there are tools available that easily organize google suggestion results such as übersuggest , which simplifies the process for you . type in your keyword and übersuggest will come up with suggestions for all of the letters in the alphabet . they even go as far as including numbers and symbols to fully grasp the way that humans search .   7 ) thesaurus   have n’t used a thesaurus since you were in college ? well now ’s the time to bring out this handy tool and go back to your glory days !   much like google suggestions , a thesaurus will help you to brainstorm relevant terms . perhaps there is another term that resonates better with your personas . you ’ll never know until you give it a shot .   8) social media and google trends   depending on current events , trending hashtags might provide some insight into what ’s popular at the moment . of course , this methodology wo n’t work with every industry , but if you ’re b2c , or a tech - friendly business , for instance , trends on twitter might help generate new ideas .   if you ’re looking for more specific topics , google offers a more expansive trends tool . with google trends , you ’ll find top searches within common categories , the day ’s “ hot searches , ” and can even explore data for specific terms !   not only will these trends help with your keyword research , but they may even provide opportunities to refine your buyer persona descriptions , as well . within the trends tool you can find information such as a term ’s interest over time , regional interest , and related searches . filter through your buyer personas considering the data you ’ve found and confirm that your definitions line up accordingly .   9 ) industry book titles   this is a technique we use a lot with our more technical clients . often , the titles of industry - specific books will incorporate the vocabulary used by thought leaders in the space . where better to find key terms than from the people teaching them ? your ideal customers are likely also learning from these material sources , and will often mimic the vocabulary throughout search queries .   hop onto amazon ( or itunes , or google books ) and do a search for your key term . take a look at the book titles . chances are you ’ll gain ideas on how the terminology is used , and get a better feel for the tone that resonates with your audience . better refine your findings by using a keyword tool to mash up multiple titles .   10 ) ask those who know best : your customers   last ( but certainly not least ) is just straight up asking your customers . what better way for finding what your ideal customers want than by listening to them ? typically , if someone is asking you a question , there ’s a good reason -- the answer is not readily or easily available on your site . start by taking a look at your faqs , analyzing your social media for common questions , and surveying your sales team , services team , and customers for a better understanding of what they 're looking and searching for . begin adding content that you know your viewers want with a double duty approach .   you ’ve built a solid list of keywords . now what ?   you do n’t need to rely solely on google to provide key terms ; you have the tools and smarts to find them on your own . give some of the ideas above a shot and build out a lengthy list of viable key terms . make sure that they broadly cover all spectrums of your sales funnel , and will be relatable and engaging for your audience .   but do n’t stop there -- as you build out more campaigns and evolve as a brand , it will be necessary to revisit and refine your keywords list , as well . growth is key , especially with rising technologies such as microphone speech options , mobile search , and even google glass . your viewers expect to find what they ’re looking for within a matter of seconds , so the more you hone in your keyword strategy , the better off you 'll be .   samantha winchell is the seo strategist at new breed marketing , an inbound marketing agency and hubspot partner . samantha manages client site optimization and outreach for new breed marketing . her passion is to discover the newest search engine trends and comprehensively optimize websites . you can read more articles by samantha and her team over at the new breed blog .\",\n",
              " '8 modern tips for marketing to millennials . you \\'ve seen the articles lamenting the death of certain industries and changing consumer attitudes , all paying tribute ( negatively or positively ) to a certain generation born in the 80s and 90s . it seems that journalists love to write about millennials and marketers love to analyze them . why , though ?   boomers hold 57 % of the wealth in the u.s. and are at peak buying power . with that in mind , is there a reason we never seem to stop hearing about millennials ?   why millennials are important to marketers   as millennials enter their 30s and 40s , often with student loans or young children , they have n\\'t yet reached their full buying power compared to genxers or boomers . nonetheless , there are multiple reasons to pay attention to this generation :   1 . millennials are the most lucrative market .   even though as a group , they have n\\'t reached their full buying power yet , their buying power eclipses that of other generations . they make up 25 % of the population , and with an estimated annual buying power of over a trillion dollars , they are the most lucrative market . plain and simple : nearly every marketer today is making generation y a priority – or at least working to understand what drives and delights this instrumental group .   2 . millennials switch brands .   millennial market research performed by daymon worldwide suggests that only 29 % of millennials will buy the same brand , which is a much lower brand loyalty score compared to previous generations .   this indicates that brands must do more to attract and keep millennial customers , leading to the need for constant innovation on marketers \\' and service teams \\' parts .   3 . millennials are tech - savvy .   according to pew research , \" almost all millennials ( nearly 100 % ) now say they use the internet . \" having grown up with or only slightly before the internet , millennials are not shy about using technology . this is attractive to brands who sell technology or use technology to sell .   4 . millennials use devices .   pew research also found that 9 out of 10 millennials have a smart phone . with widespread device ownership and use comes a higher likelihood of consuming web content , which gives rise to different modes of marketing .   one key element that justifies millennial domination of the marketplace is the fact this new marketing style – which we ’ll delve into in just a minute – is n’t just a fad . here , we ’ll discuss important tactics for marketing to the demographic of the hour and explain why these tactics are lasting ones .   how to market to millennials create authentic content . ditch outbound marketing methods . be informative with inbound marketing , instead . put them first and connect organically . market with intention rather than latching on to gimmicky marketing fads . be open to collaboration . push the convenient and practical side . lean into the fun and the experiential .   1 . create authentic content .   millennials are spending an average of 242 minutes online or using apps per day , and they ’re craving content - driven media . they ’re scouring websites , blogs , and social media because they feel empowered by all of the remarkable content they ’re discovering . they ’re also sharing , liking , pinning , tweeting , snapping , forwarding , and commenting on all of their findings to impart this sense of empowerment to the online community . so , what makes this type of content really resonate with this group ? millennials trust what they feel is authentic .   interacting in a user - centric environment is what engages them , as 90 % of millennials say authenticity is important to them when deciding which brands they support . today , young shoppers ’ attitudes and behavior are largely inspired by people they know in person or online , or even strangers who share their interests on social networks . millennials carry these “ advisors ” with them on their smartphones and everywhere they go . they trust relevant , authentic opinions from real product users they can relate to . in fact , millennials believe that user - generated content is 35 % more memorable than other media .   for brands that want to successfully reach gen y - ers , they simply need to speak their language . people ages 18 to 34 will perk up when hearing or reading words that could have come from the mouths of their peers , as these messages warrant comfort and trust . when you offer your audience content they would proudly share with others , you ’re building a real brand - consumer relationship .   2 . ditch outbound marketing methods .   millennials want to feel connected and involved when it comes to their purchases , and traditional marketing does not encourage this . outbound marketing methods , like magazine ads , direct mail campaigns , and radio spots , do not impress millennials . in the mind of a young consumer , these campaigns are impersonal and company - focused , filled with logos and void of any real substance . this generation demands more customer - driven , personalized marketing . only 1 % of millennials say a compelling advertisement can build trust ( crowdtap ) .   that ’s why these young consumers do a lot of their research via blogs , forums , and youtube videos . odds are that an intrusive ad is n’t going to be a deciding factor . while such ads may be relevant to the person ’s search history and may put the idea in the their head , seeing it was n’t their choice . millennials feel empowered to make their own online choices – which are usually inspired by their peers or other authentic content .   3 . be informative with inbound marketing , instead .   millennials support businesses that are dedicated to improving their customers ’ lives with informative content . rather than product and service listings , millennials want e - books , whitepapers , blog posts , videos , and other how - to information – and that ’s inbound marketing . they appreciate thought leadership and expertise , so this is your company ’s chance to provide killer content that ranks highly in google and show young consumers that you ’re the industry buff .   mac cosmetics ’ youtube page is a great example of how brands can offer their audience how - to ’s from the experts . people want helpful guidance , and when your company takes the time to provide that , they appreciate it and respect what you stand for . mac is giving young viewers exactly what they want , where they ’ll find it . 54 % of millennials check youtube daily , so utilizing youtube is perfect . a millennial makeup lover is much more likely to tell her friends to check out mac ’s makeup tutorials than show her friends a print ad of mac talking about how great they are .   4 . put them first and connect organically .   millennials want to feel like your content was created with their interest ( not their wallet ) in mind . when this is the case , they are more organically introduced to purchasing your products or services . without ever being “ pushy , ” your educational content helps build strong brand - consumer relationships . people appreciate honesty , and brands with transparent campaigns win .     and , what ’s more transparent than encapsulating the spontaneous adventures of travelers in hostels – with skinny dipping ? hostelworld ’s meet the world advertising campaign , which features genuine travelers that are strangers upon meeting and share a once in a lifetime adventure of skinny dipping , celebrates real travelers in real places who crave adventures , not souvenirs . this successfully speaks to millennials because it screams “ live ! ” instead of “ buy ! ” – and that ’s something that ’ll stick with them . most young people would rather have an unforgettable experience than seek out luxury , and hostelworld gets that .   5 . market with intention rather than latching on to gimmicky marketing fads .   if you think content marketing is a passing trend , think again ! here are some key examples of how content marketing has succeeded over the years :   1895 : john deere introduces the furrow , a free publication with tons of farming tips and techniques to help farmers become more profitable . today , it ’s available in more than 40 countries and in 12 different languages .   john deere introduces the furrow , a free publication with tons of farming tips and techniques to help farmers become more profitable . today , it ’s available in more than 40 countries and in 12 different languages . 1900 : michelin tires released a 400 - page auto maintenance guide with everyday drivers in mind , and also included travel tips . 35,000 copies were distributed free of charge before the company started selling the manual for a profit .   michelin tires released a 400 - page auto maintenance guide with everyday drivers in mind , and also included travel tips . 35,000 copies were distributed free of charge before the company started selling the manual for a profit . 1904 : jell - o circulated free copies of its own cookbook , highlighting creative ways to use the unique product . in 2 years , the company saw sales increase to over $ 1 million annually .   jell - o circulated free copies of its own cookbook , highlighting creative ways to use the unique product . in 2 years , the company saw sales increase to over $ 1 million annually . 1966 : nike released a 19 - page booklet titled jogging . it was filled with advice on enjoying running as a recreational activity , including posture and striking tips . this brought running , as a sport , to america , and it never once mentioned a nike shoe .     we know that millennial consumers value awesome , authentic content – so it looks like content marketing is n’t going away anytime soon . the inbound methodology , with its emphasis on strong and consistent content creation , is not a fad and will continue to win over your ideal customers .   6 . be open to collaboration .   today , millennials are interested in having a say and becoming product co - creators . in fact , 42 percent said they are interested in helping companies develop future products and services . in our society , companies usually create products and hope that their target market will consume them . when it comes to millennials , they want to be more involved with how products get created . so , companies that enable them to be part of the product development process will be more successful . marketers need to focus on building relationships with consumers by fueling their self - expression and helping them establish their own personal brand .     coca - cola used online co - creation to gather expressions of its brand promise “ energizing refreshment . ” they prompted their audience to unleash their creativity by interpreting coca - cola as an energizing refreshment in whatever style or format they wished . coca - cola gathered these videos , animations , illustrations , and photographs to use in its marketing campaigns worldwide . this method was mutually beneficially in that millennials all over the world got to pour a bit of themselves into a product made for them , while helping coca - cola bring fresh authenticity to the market .   7 . push the convenient and practical side .   millennials prefer use over ownership , saying they would rather pay full price to access an item when they need it as opposed to owning it . these shoppers would rather rent , share , and barter than buy .     in this new “ sharing economy , ” mobile services and apps such as spotify and airbnb , and fashion sites like rent the runway and relapse clothing , have taken advantage of this crucial opportunity . this is also a new trend in the automotive industry . according to an analysis recently released by car - buying platform edmunds , millennials are acquiring cars – they ’re just not buying them . instead , they ’re opting to lease more luxurious , tech - forward cars than they could otherwise afford to buy , such as ram , gmc , and lexus models . capitalizing on this “ sharing ” mentality is a smart move for modern businesses , especially those targeting millennials . offer more creative and feasible options so that , in case consumers ca n’t yet buy , they can at least try .   8 . lean into the fun and the experiential .   young consumers increasingly see the act of researching and browsing for a purchase more compelling than the purchase itself . millennials tend to crave the experience of shopping more than the purchase . in other words , online exploration is becoming more than a means to an end , with many young shoppers viewing e - commerce as a form of entertainment . this phenomenon has been coined as “ fauxsumerism . ” pinterest is a perfect example of how the shopping journey can also become an act of personal expression . this social platform , which helps users catalog prospective purchases by curating collections of items of interest , accurately reflects the facts that 40 percent of millennials make wish lists of products they want to buy ( the intelligence group ) .     successful companies understand that young consumers want to have an enjoyable online browsing experience , which is why brands like etsy show off their products on pinterest , making perusing and pinning fun and social . no matter what platform you use , you should market to millennials in entertaining ways in order to effectively engage them and inspire activity .   marketing to millennials is a long - term play because this group is wired for authentic , content - driven , honest experiences that cater to who they are and their voices they yearn to share . empower them with the pieces they ’re looking for in this puzzling world and remind them that , because of their generation , the bigger picture is looking brighter . keep this sentiment in mind as you consider millennials as one of your buyer personas .   editor \\'s note : this post was originally published in august 2015 and has been updated for comprehensiveness .',\n",
              " '6 underutilized lead sources your agency should be tapping ( besides referrals ) . your agency can not survive on referrals alone .   do n\\'t get me wrong -- referrals are great ( really great ) , but your agency \\'s new business program needs to span a more diverse range of new lead sources in case your referral pipeline ever hits a dry spell .   according to the agency pricing & financials report conducted by hubspot research , a whopping 90 % of agencies cite referrals as their top source for new leads .   data from the agency pricing & financials report   but while it \\'s clear referrals represent a big portion of agency new business , it \\'s not necessarily a safe bet to rely on referrals as the default new business option .   lee mcknight , vice president of sales at rsw / us , warns that referrals are n\\'t always as scalable , reliable , or targeted as other new lead sources , and agencies that ignore other inbound and outbound sources do so at their own peril .   \" there ’s a reason insurance exists , \" mcknight writes in the agency pricing & financials report . \" if you ’re crushing it on the referral front , look at the outbound / inbound component as your insurance policy ; it ’s not the easiest part , but it ’s absolutely necessary to your success . \"   to help your agency start exploring new lead sources , we \\'ve examined a few underutilized new business channels and explained how agencies can better use them to their advantage . read on to learn how your agency can start tapping these new lead sources and building up a more sustainable new business program .   6 new lead sources your agency should tap   1 ) blogging   \" oh great -- another article with blogging as a marketing tip . \"   look , i hear you . marketers love to talk about blogging , and it often gets thrown around as a default inbound marketing strategy . but with only 12 % of agencies reporting blogging as a top lead source , it seems like agencies still are n\\'t fully taking advantage of this powerful channel for new business .   the reason blogging does n\\'t work is usually a bandwidth issue , not a talent gap . and we get it : you \\'re busy , your client work comes first , and everyone on your team is already juggling roughly 10,000 responsibilities on a daily basis .   but many agencies fail to see results from blogging simply because they do n\\'t devote the time and patience to cultivating a meaningful blog presence . they just whip up a few generic posts every now and then , post them to social media , and then decide it is n\\'t worthwhile .   if your agency wants to start seriously using blogging as a new business channel , it ca n\\'t be seen as a sometimes project . it needs to be a core part of your marketing strategy .   even if you do n\\'t have a dedicated new business employee , designate a member of your team to manage the blog and produce content that target \\'s your agency \\'s desired niche ( click here for a free guide on creating an ideal client profile ) .   blogging does n\\'t have to be their core responsibility ( and others can and should help out ) , but there needs to be someone held accountable for your blog \\'s performance . otherwise , you ca n\\'t reasonably expect buy - in from the rest of your team .   2 ) guest blogging   agencies put guest blogging at the very bottom of their priority list , with just 1 % of agencies surveyed reporting the tactic as a valuable new business source . but this overlooked marketing strategy can actually be a great way to build authority , get important eyes on your content , and start generating some targeted buzz for your agency .   start by finding industry publications and media outlets that share the kind of content your ideal prospects are interested in . you want to target the websites where your prospects are most likely to come across your content .   next , sit down and develop a list of topics you think would bring value to your prospects . examine the previously published content on the publications you plan to submit to , and try to locate content gaps : topics that have n\\'t been covered yet , or new angles on topics that you can offer a fresh perspective on .   once you know what you want to write about , read up on how to pitch your story idea to the editors . make sure you read up on your desired publication \\'s guidelines and rules . you can find hubspot \\'s agency content submission guidelines here .   3 ) webinars   webinars are an opportunity to offer potential prospects a glimpse at your expertise , and help them get an idea of what you can bring to the table . only 2 % of agencies currently say that webinars serve as a valuable new lead source , but when done right , this tactic can be a powerful component of your lead generation program .   many agencies balk at the idea of putting on a webinar at first . and while it can seem like a massive undertaking with an uncertain chance of return , hosting a webinar does n\\'t have to be complicated or overly time - consuming . in fact , with the right tools , it can be an easy way to start building an online reputation and cultivating meaningful relationships in your industry .   services like gotowebinar and webex make it simple to plan , broadcast , and record webinars . and if your agency does n\\'t currently have the budget for a paid service , consider recording your webinar with google hangouts or another free service like join.me .   4 ) paid online marketing   adding a budget for paid or sponsored media to your new business development plan can give your content a much - needed boost with some targeted amplification . most agencies ignore paid marketing altogether , with only 7 % reporting it as a valuable lead generation channel .   but if your agency has gone through the time and effort to produce valuable content offers , introducing paid content can dramatically increase your impressions and ensure your content gets noticed by the right people .   figure out where your potential clients are most likely to spot you on the web , and devote your funds to these channels . to promote your agency on social media , consider linkedin sponsored updates , promoted tweets on twitter , and facebook ads .   5 ) public relations and earned media   it \\'s pretty simple : if you do n\\'t pitch stories , they wo n\\'t get covered . only 7 % of agencies report public relations as a top lead source . to make earned media part of your agency \\'s new business plan , you \\'ll need to focus on finding the right journalists to cover your story .   so how do you craft the perfect pitch ? it \\'s all about targeting the right publications with the right stories , and differentiating yourself . journalists see 26,000 pitches a year , so it \\'s easy to get lost in the shuffle . but do n\\'t fret -- despite what you might think , journalists actually want to find a great story in their inbox . they do n\\'t enjoy sifting through a mass of irrelevant pitches .   targeting is key . do n\\'t pitch anything you think is a stretch . set up news alerts for topics in your industry and use them to find journalists who are already writing the kind of stories you want to share . if you are n\\'t sure how to write a stellar pitch , click here for a few free email pitch templates tailored to agencies .   6 ) networking events and conferences   old school face - to - face networking is n\\'t dead yet . in fact , 37 % of agencies reported that networking at events and conferences brings in new leads . but that means the majority of agencies still are n\\'t fully taking advantage of networking and the new business potential it can bring in .   i \\'ll be the first to tell you that networking in person can be hard , and it does n\\'t always come naturally to everyone . but that does n\\'t mean your agency can afford to shy away from the conference and event scene altogether .   you should n\\'t feel foolish if you need to brush up on some networking skills and ice breakers . with inbound 2016 right around the corner , you can bet that all of us here at hubspot have been practicing our small talk skills . unsure where to begin ? try browsing this list of 100 conversation starters for virtually any situation .   what under -

              " \"topic clusters : the next evolution of seo . written with contributions from leslie ye , matthew barby , anum hussain , and cambria davies   tl;dr : influential search engines like google have changed their algorithm to favor topic - based content . as a result , websites are exploring a new way of linking related content under a “ topic clusters ” model . this report serves as a tactical primer for marketers responsible for seo strategies .   minute   ( 8 - read )   while you cheerfully ( or apathetically ) browse the web , many companies are quietly reconfiguring their web pages in the background . why ?   because the competition to rank in search engine results is intense . as a result , content - focused websites have adopted new best practices . seo is now shifting to a topic cluster model .   in this model , a single “ pillar ” page acts as the main hub of content for an overarching topic . multiple content pages that are related to that topic link back to the pillar page . this linking action signals to search engines that the pillar page is an authority on the topic , and over time , the page may rank higher for the topic it covers .   the topic cluster model , at its core , is a way of organizing a site ’s content pages using a cleaner and more deliberate site architecture .   source : matt barby   watch the video below to learn more about the topic cluster methodology :   search engines are forcing websites to adapt   marketers and seo experts are not going through the tedious process of overhauling their site structure just to get ahead of consumer behavior . they ’re being forced to because search engines have changed their algorithms in response to consumers ’ behavioral changes .   years ago , people posed fragmented keyword queries to search engines to find answers to their questions . nowadays , people are asking search engines more complex questions , and they expect an accurate and timely answer .   searchers who want a specific answer also use many different phrases in their queries . search engines are now smart enough to recognize the connections across these queries . algorithms have evolved to the point where they can understand the topical context behind the search intent , tie it back to similar searches they have encountered in the past , and deliver web pages that best answer the query .   the first big shake - up related to this change occurred with google ’s hummingbird update in 2013 . the search algorithm began parsing out phrases rather than focusing solely on keywords . many seo professionals see hummingbird as google ’s official switch from a keyword to a topic focus .   the next major step toward reliance on topics was google ’s rankbrain update . launched in 2015 , rankbrain is google ’s machine learning algorithm designed to understand the context of people ’s search queries . it associates past searches with similar themes and pulls multiple keywords and phrases that are associated with the search query to find the best results .   do topic clusters actually impact serps ?   in light of these algorithm changes , former hubspotters anum hussain and cambria davies launched topic cluster experiments in 2016 . the extensive findings from their initial topic cluster experiments showed that the more interlinking they did , the better the placement in search engine results pages ( serps ) . impressions ( or views ) also increased with the number of links they created .   source : anum hussain and cambria davies   what does this mean for my website ?   before the shift to topic clusters , hubspot ’s website structure looked like the image below .   source : matt barby   the master url hosts the homepage and links to subdomains or subdirectories .   you can see the spread of web pages within hubspot ’s subdomains . as hubspot produces more content , the blog pages increase and the structure becomes more complex because there 's no uniform linking in place . this setup makes it harder for search engines to crawl through all the pages quickly .   hubspot , and many similar businesses that invest in content , find themselves with dozens of web pages that cover similar topic areas . all these pages end up competing with each other to get found by search engines , and ultimately , the searcher .   to prevent this , a more orderly , thoughtful arrangement is needed — one that tells search engines what page should be prioritized and displayed for the main topic . all the pages related to that topic can then be organized as one interlinked cluster .   topic clusters rearrange a website ’s structure to look more like the image below . clusters of content that cover a topic area link to a central pillar page that definitively — yet broadly — outlines the topic .   source : matt barby   how do i create a topic cluster ?   let ’s use the topic of “ content marketing ” as an example . audit your existing content pages and group them by topic focus . if needed , create a pillar page on content marketing that captures all the key aspects of the topic in a single page ( see the example below ) .   example topic feature : content marketing   content marketing strategy   brainstorming techniques   blogging   blogging mistakes   buyer personas   writing skills   writing productivity   buyer ’s journey   gated content   growing readership   content planning   content creation tools   blog post topics   grammar fails   post types   scaling content output   note that pillar pages need to broadly cover the topic you ’re focusing on so that you can link all related content pages to it in a sensible way .   the cluster content you create or optimize should go into depth on just one area mentioned on the pillar page . for example , if you have a pillar page on search engine optimization , a cluster content page would detail how to optimize your site architecture for search engines .   think of your content assets in terms of topics you want your business to compete in , rather than discrete keywords . the keywords can still play into your overall strategy , but topics are now the umbrella under which your keyword strategy operates .   leslie ye , who overhauled a large number of hubspot ’s content pages into clusters , sums up the art of choosing topics for clusters :   “ when considering whether something should be called a pillar page or not , ask yourself this : would this page answer every question the reader who searched x keyword had , and is it broad enough to be an umbrella for 20 - 30 posts ?   a good sniff test here is — if you ’re trying to get the page you ’re working on to rank for a long - tail keyword , it ’s not a pillar page . if the page you ’re working on explores a very narrow topic in great depth , it ’s not a pillar page . if the page you ’re working on touches on many aspects of a broad topic , it ’s probably a pillar page . ”   in the example below , if you wanted to own the term “ inbound marketing , ” you would research related topics or long - tail keywords , create content on those subtopics , and then link back to an inbound marketing pillar page to create your cluster .   once you have a designated pillar page , update the links in the related content pages you ’ve identified to form a “ cluster ” around the pillar page . every post in the cluster set needs to be linked to at least once with the same anchor text ( the part that is hyperlinked ) so that a search engine knows it ’s part of a topic cluster .   over time , monitor the pillar page ’s ranking within search engines . when your ranking stabilizes and you ’ve grown your authority on the topic , you can take the chain of clusters further by linking out to a related topic .   a natural follow - up cluster to the “ content marketing ” topic could be the next step in the content marketing process , such as how to create content that converts .   tactical tips to get started with topic clusters   choosing a topic to create cluster content around and auditing existing content can be downright painful , especially if your company has an extensive archive . here are a few suggestions to help you organize and create topic clusters .   map out five to ten core problems that your buyer persona has . use surveys , run interviews , and do some secondary research within online communities as needed to gather the data .   group each of the problems into broad topic areas .   build out each of the core topics with subtopics using keyword research .   map out content ideas that align with each of the core topics and corresponding subtopics .   validate each idea with industry and competitive research .   create content , measure the impact , and refine .   to keep track of content and links within a topic cluster , your team can set up a sheet like the one below . depending on the complexity of the topic and the number of pages you ’re linking to , some of the categories may not be necessary .   the categories to track include the following .   page url   cluster topic   subcluster ( if applicable )   keyword to rank for   is it linked to the pillar page ? ( y / n )   is it relinked ( if applicable ) ? ( y / n )   any other actions needed   has the other action been taken yet ? ( y / n )   links out to pages 1 , 2 , 3 , and/or 4   is it also a sub - pillar page ( if applicable ) ? ( y / n )   help is on the way   many companies are also developing tools to help marketing teams organize content around topics . point solutions on the market , such as marketmuse , identify content gaps and can help you organize and optimize content by topic cluster .   image source   hubspot also has a content strategy tool that helps you create , execute , and measure content in topics .   machine learning helps marketers identify the cluster topics ( or long - tail keywords ) that their target personas typically search for and offers subtopic suggestions . soon , there will be more tools to help seo specialists and marketers create topic clusters to maximize their content strategies .   image source   this report contains links for hubspot content , products , and services .   editor ’s note : this post was originally published in 2017 but was updated in 2022 for comprehensiveness .\",\n",
              " 'how to rank above position 1 ? get position zero .. why do some web pages show up \" above \" the first search result ? this is called a featured snippet , or \" position zero \" in the seo field and it \\'s one of the ways google positions for seo are counted . it \\'s important because as voice search becomes more common , google uses the featured snippet or \" position zero \" result for its \" one true answers \" response to voice searches .   for instance , we searched \" featured snippet \" in google , and here \\'s what happened :   what is a featured snippet ?   featured snippets are answers that appear right in search results and are pulled from relevant websites . included in the snippet is a summary and the details of the web page where the answer was pulled from , including the url . these snippets are a very powerful space to occupy as content with a featured snippet gets a 2x higher click - through rate .   let \\'s say that your page has ranked at the number one position on the search results because of your hard work optimizing your page . further , your web page answers a specific question , lays it out plainly , and therefore google uses your content as the featured snippet for that term ... sometimes .   this is like being the king and queen at the same time . being placed above the top search result really makes the featured snippet the top search result , but for the sake of practicality , it has been dubbed position # 0 .   two search results for position zero become one   it used to be that you could get two positions in a search result page , the regular organic result plus the featured snippet . position zero has changed recently though . a recent update by google removes the second search result in favor of the featured snippet . so now you only get one position zero result , and no \" regular \" organic result as a secondary link on the first page . but which one would you prefer ? most would say position zero is the better of the two because it ranks higher than a normal organic result .   how to get a featured snippet   getting your blog to rank as a featured snippet means that you have thoroughly answered a commonly searched question . essentially , you are the first thing people see when they search for that question , so your page must be completely comprehensive .   google chooses one of the pages from the first ten search results to also get the position zero spot . so if you \\'re already ranking on the first page of google , consider optimizing your post for the featured snippet position .   here are a few ways to increase your chances of ranking for position zero :   focus on long - tail keywords   target question - based search terms   use a clear page structure with headings and paragraph tags   keep your answers to questions around 54 - 58 words long   does position \" 0 \" help voice search ?   yes . google and bing are moving towards voice search quickly , in fact , they \\'re already there . the answers to voice searches with devices like echo and google home , and apple homepod are also vocal responses . there is only one answer , the best one . just like the star trek computer . featured snippets are a move in that direction . t ’s estimated that about half of teenagers and adults alike use voice search every day .   before voice search , and even before google was the world ’s go - to resource for answers , search engines were merely directories and portals to the wide , untamed internet . a dramatic change came in 2012 when google introduced knowledge graph , a smart system that understands how people , places , and things are all connected . a few other things happened and now we are almost to the point where voice search is dominant .   voice search is only continuing to gain popularity . in 2019 , emarketer estimated that 111.8 million people in the u.s. used a voice assistant at least monthly , up 9.5 % from the previous year . this is equivalent to 39.4 % of internet users and 33.8 % of the total population .   results are organically generated   if you ’re wondering how google generates these results , you ’re in for a pleasant surprise - the results are generated organically , based on the relevance of the information . google programmatically searches for the answer on websites , determines the best , and displays it for searchers .   a few things play into which webpage \\'s content is featured as the snippet :   first page results . it ’s necessary that your page is on the first page of search results for your given search query . usually in the first five results . relevant information . the answer you provide has to be the right answer , and the information on the page must be relevant to the search term overall . useful formatting . if you ’ve formatted your answer like this answer is , or if you ’ve got a nice table of information , google will be more likely to display it .   what is the “ people also ask ” box ?   below the featured snippet , there is also sometimes a clickable list of related questions . these could also be considered \" position zero , \" since they \\'re appearing before the “ top ” search result .   growth of featured snippets   the featured snippet has seen a ton of growth in the years since its inception , and people also ask boxes are rising even faster . although even less is known about how the extra question boxes are generated than featured snippets , one thing can be said for sure : there \\'s no definite cap on how many faqs are displayed .   if you come across a people also ask box , try expanding some of the results . if you ’re lucky , you ’ll notice that more results are loaded at the bottom of the feature as you expand results . this can lead to a never ending black hole of people also ask options !   coveted position   no matter how you look at it , the featured snippet box is a highly coveted position . if you ’ve designed your content to answer a specific question , hold a high rank in the search results , and have used the appropriate combination of headings , bold lists , and other text callouts , you may see your page being used as a featured snippet .   if you are not , think about how you might improve your brand \\'s web presence through better seo .   featured snippet faqs   what is a featured snippet ?

              " 'keyword research : the complete beginner ’s guide . as a blogger , i ’m sure you ’ve come across the term ‘ keyword research ’ . but perhaps you ’re not quite sure what it entails ?   in short , keyword research involves finding the keywords ( or search queries ) that represent your site and your blog .   and once your research is done , you can start optimizing your content and landing pages for those keywords , so it appears in the top search results .   sure , there are plenty of tactics you can use to boost your rankings but it all starts with this . in time , your efforts could result in a significant increase in traffic to your blog .   before we cover the keyword research process in depth , we ’ll take a look at what keywords are , the different types of search queries that exist , and the difference between short and long tail keywords .   let ’s get started .   what are keywords ?   keywords are words and phrases that describe what your content is about .   in blogging and seo terms you can think of keywords as the linchpin between what people are searching for – their search queries – and the content you are providing .   in a moment we ’ll take a look at the different types of keywords , but first , let ’s look at search queries .   what are search queries ?   search queries are the words and phrases that you type into a search box . according to a paper by pennsylvania state university , there are three types of search queries :   navigational ( go )   informational ( know )   transactional ( do )   navigational   a navigational search query is often called a ‘ go ‘ query because it ’s used when people want to find a particular website or webpage . for instance , i ’m sure you ’ve heard a brand name come up in conversation and thought to yourself i must check their website later . so you enter a specific term , like ‘ blogging wizard ‘ , into the search bar :   note : google will recognize your search intent is for a quick hit and will only display the top 7 results rather than the usual 10 . try it and see .   informational – research related ( ? ):   an informational search query is all about people researching topics and finding answers . hence it ’s also called the ‘ know ‘ query .   some examples of these research queries are :   you want answers to questions : “ how do i write a blog post ? “   “ you ’re doing research : “ what is content marketing ? “   “ you want to solve or fix a problem yourself ( diy ): “ how do you restore a page in wordpress ? “   transactional – buyer related ( $ ):   a transactional search query is used when people are ready to make a buying decision or become a lead . these are called ‘ do ‘ queries because an action is imminent .   some examples of these buyer intent searches are :   you want the best , latest , fastest , smallest : best dslr camera under £ 500   you want to compare a vs b : canon t6 vs nikon d3400   you want a discount or coupon : canon eos discount codes     notice how these are more specific and punchy .   short tail vs long tail keywords   i ’ll let you in on a secret .   when i started blogging and heard the term ‘ keyword ’ i thought it referred to a single word . so , when someone asked , “ what keyword are you targeting on your page ? ” i ’d give a one - word answer like , “ wordpress . ”   that ’s how i thought it worked back then .   now i know different . a keyword can be one or more words .   keywords fall into three categories :   short tail , also called head   , also called medium tail , also called body   , also called long tail   the term ‘ long tail ’ comes from the so - called ‘ search demand curve ‘ – a graph , that plots all keywords by their search volumes – that has the appearance of long tail :   this example , from seopressor , highlights the difference between short , medium , and long tail keywords :   short tail keywords usually consist of one or two words ; for example , ‘ wordpress themes ’ . these keywords are broad and generic , but often ambiguous , with a high search volume .   usually consist of one or two words ; for example , ‘ wordpress themes ’ . these keywords are broad and generic , but often ambiguous , with a high search volume . middle tail keywords usually consist of three or four words ; for example , ‘ wordpress themes for blog ’ . they are more specific than short tail keywords but have less search volume .   usually consist of three or four words ; for example , ‘ wordpress themes for blog ’ . they are more specific than short tail keywords but have less search volume . long tail keywords usually consist of four or more words ; for example , ‘ free responsive wordpress themes for blog ’ . these are more detailed and very specific , but the search volume is even lower .   note : i ’ve used the term ‘ usually consist ’ because the number of words is not important . it ’s the search volume and specificity that determine whether it ’s a short or long tail keyword .   you ’ll notice the conversion rate increases as the ‘ tail ’ increases . that ’s because long tail keywords have more chance of matching the search query .   it ’s easy to be seduced by the high search volume of short tail keywords , but they usually face fierce competition .   try searching for the three terms above and see how many results you get for each one . here ’s what i found :   keyword search results average searches / month wordpress themes 10,100,000 164,232 wordpress themes for blog 3,450,000 90 free responsive wordpress themes for blog 423,000 20   later on we ’ll look at evaluating search volume and competition in your keyword research , but for now , you can see it ’s better to use medium and long tail keywords .   note : it ’s also worth noting that search volume is n’t as important as it once was . google has rolled out a lot more serp features ( featured snippets , etc . ) which eat up potential traffic . so , avoid using search volume as a single metric to decide whether or not to try and rank for a keyword . intent and relevance to your business is more important .   the keyword research process   now you know about the different types of search queries and keywords , it ’s time to dive into keyword research .   there are four main parts to the keyword research process :   i recommend using a spreadsheet ( excel or google ) to keep a record of your keywords as you go along . as we move through each step , we ’ll take a look at some of the other tools you can use to help you .   part 1 – find the seed   to start your keyword research , you ’ll need some seeds or ideas . the goal here is to find the words and phrases that your audience and customers are interested in and using .   you need to go hunting . but where ?   go to the places online where your customers hang out . depending on your niche , it could be :   forums   reviews   wikis   quora   reddit   emails   blog comments   facebook groups   let ’s take a look at a few examples .   amazon reviews   checking customer reviews on amazon provides plenty of ideas as to what people are interested in . so , for example , if you wanted to find ideas for content marketing , you could check content chemistry by andy crestodina ( which i highly recommend ) .   here are a few snippets from the amazon reviews :   when you summarize the highlights from above , you get this list of ideas :   optimizing blog posts   increasing web traffic   writing tips   creating headlines   keyword research   connecting with content creators   connecting with content promoters   connecting with influencers   guest blogging strategy   optimizing landing pages   not bad for starters !   quora questions   use the search bar in quora to see what questions people are asking about a topic . for example , when you enter the term ‘ wordpress plugins ’ , you ’ll see these types of questions :   and if you look on the right - hand side of the screen , you ’ll see a related questions section :   wikipedia   wikis are an excellent source of ideas that are all curated and arranged into categories . here ’s how to use wikipedia to find some ideas on the topic of cricket .   1 ) head over to wikipedia and type in a broad topic ; for example , cricket :   2 ) look for the “ contents ” section of the page :   3 ) take a look at each section , and you ’ll find some ideas :   4 ) some sections link onto other pages so that you can go deeper . for example , ‘ types of match ‘ leads onto ‘ forms of cricket ‘ :   5 ) when you check the contents section on that page , you get even more ideas . take a look at all the types of amateur cricket :   facebook groups   people are always asking and answering questions in online communities like facebook groups . here ’s a snapshot of answers from a freelance writers group to the question : “ what business or writing skill do you want to master ? ”   emails   you can scan through your email outbox to see if any topics come up consistently . these are good ideas for web content . people want answers to questions , so use what you ’ve already written .   part 2 – search for keywords   once you ’ve gathered your ideas , it ’s time to go searching for keywords . there are loads of keyword research tools available , but in this section , we ’ll use two :   let ’s take a look at how you can use them .   kwfinder   the kwfinder ( aff ) tool offers a full - featured 10 - day free trial – no credit card required .   when you log into your account , you ’ll see a simple search bar waiting for you to input your keyword :   there are three options :   suggestions uses the kwfinder database and algorithm and is the main option .   autocomplete uses the google autocomplete feature ( sometimes called google suggest ) to prepend and append your keyword with different letters or words . for example , ‘ indoor cricket near me ’ :   questions is similar to autocomplete and will prepend the main seed keyword with question words . for example , ‘ how many overs in indoor cricket ’ :   note : in this example , there is no search volume trend data .   using the keyword suggestions   let ’s take the example from earlier and use ‘ indoor cricket ‘ as our starting point . next to the keyword , you can enter your location and language . for instance , you may want to enter ‘ germany ‘ and ‘ german ‘ if your website is designed for that market .   the results screen is in two halves :   the left - hand side shows the keyword suggestions along with some metrics :   here are the metrics with example figures from the first line :   trend – the search volume trend ( mini graph ) in the last 12 months   – the search volume trend ( mini graph ) in the last 12 months search – the average monthly search volume ( exact match ) in the last 12 months ; e.g. 3,455   – the average monthly search volume ( exact match ) in the last 12 months ; e.g. cpc – the average cost per click of the listed keyword in google adwords ; e.g. $ 1.13   – the average cost per click of the listed keyword in google adwords ; e.g. ppc – the level of competition in ppc advertising ( min = 0 ; max = 100 ) ; e.g. 4 ( low )   – the level of competition in ppc advertising ( min = 0 ; max = 100 ) ; e.g. kd – the seo difficulty of a keyword ( more on this later ) ; e.g. 37 ( achievable )   if your results need fine - tuning , you can use the filter . in the example above , one of the suggestions was ‘ indoor sports ’ , which is not relevant . using the filter you can exclude the word ‘ sports ’ :   and now your results only display cricket related keywords :   on the right - hand side , you can see an enlarged kd score and trend graph :   underneath those you can see the google serp ( search engine results page ) statistics and other important metrics that contribute to the lps score :   google serp – these are the top results from google search for your selected keyword   – these are the top results from google search for your selected keyword da – domain authority predicts how well a website will rank on search engines   – domain authority predicts how well a website will rank on search engines pa – page authority predicts how well a specific page will rank on search engines   – page authority predicts how well a specific page will rank on search engines mr – mozrank of the url represents a link popularity score   – mozrank of the url represents a link popularity score mt – moztrust of the url measures trustworthiness of the link   – moztrust of the url measures trustworthiness of the link links – the number of external authority - passing links to the url   – the number of external authority - passing links to the url fb – the number of facebook shares for the url   – the number of facebook shares for the url lps – overall link profile strength of the url – the higher it is , the harder it is to compete . ( min = 0 ; max = 100 )   – overall link profile strength of the url – the higher it is , the harder it is to compete . ( min = 0 ; max = 100 ) visits – the estimated visits per month on this serp position   note : a lot of these metrics have been created by third parties ( such as moz ) . this means that it ’s another company ’s interpretation of what google might think about a page or website . ultimately , it ’s what google thinks that matters , so use these metrics as a reference point only . and avoid using them as a factor in the making of any important decision . we ’ll talk about how you can use these metrics later in this post .   managing your keywords in kwfinder   there are three ways to manage your keywords in kwfinder , no matter which option you use .   1 . keyword lists management   lists allow you to keep and categorize the data you find from your keyword research . you can check each suggestion you want to keep and add it to a new or an existing list . for example , this list contains four keyword suggestions :   2 . import your own keywords   you can import your own lists of keywords into kwfinder in various ways :   write the keywords as separate tags   upload your txt or csv file   drag - and - drop your file   this is useful for adding the seeds and ideas from step 1 in the keyword research process .   3 . export your results   you can also export your keywords from either the suggestions table or your keyword lists . you have the option to export to a csv file ( with or without metrics ) or copy to the clipboard .   answer the public   answer the public is a free research tool that also extends the autocomplete results you see in google and bing .   the premise is simple :   you enter your keyword and ask the seeker ( the impatient , bald guy ) for content ideas . you also select your preferred language :   the content ideas come in different categories :   questions – what , where , why , which , how .   prepositions – with , to , for , like .   comparisons – like , and , or , vs.   alphabetical – a , b , c , etc .   for ‘ indoor cricket ‘ , the seeker found – questions ( 11 ) , prepositions ( 84 ) , alphabetical ( 483 ):   for ‘ wordpress themes ‘ , the results were higher – questions ( 136 ) , prepositions ( 114 ) , comparisons ( 80 ) , alphabetical ( 490 ):   you can download the complete results in a csv file , using the button in the top - right corner . or you scroll down the page where you ’ll see the results presented in two easier - to - read formats .   the first one is a one - page visualization of the results :   indoor cricket questions   wordpress themes comparison   the second option is to see the results listed in sections :   indoor cricket questions   wordpresss themes questions   summary   answer the public generates more suggestions and questions than the kwfinder options . save and use those content ideas to check further in kwfinder where you also have the metrics .   for more tools , check out my comparison of keyword research tools here on blogging wizard .   part 3 – check volume and competition   by now you should have plenty of keywords , but there ’s one crucial step remaining : the evaluation .   what ’s the point in using a keyword that nobody is searching for ?   what ’s the point in using a keyword if nobody is going to see it ?   in short , you ’re evaluating volume ( is it worth it ? ) and competition ( is it achievable ? )   volume   search volume is always an approximate value . whether you use a free tool or a premium tool , there will be differences in the search volume results they return . which is odd , because most keyword research tools get their data from the google keyword planner ( gkp ) either directly or indirectly .   ahrefs ran an experiment to show this :   note : ahrefs is not included in the comparison as it uses a combination of clickstream data and gkp data to produce its results .   the underlying reason for this discrepancy is that the search volume in google keyword planner is a rounded annual average , which means they re - calculate it every month . but many of the tools using the gkp data do n’t recalculate every month , so their figures become skewed .   if your keyword has a high seasonal variation , and your keyword tool does n’t recalculate it , then you ’re looking at false data . for instance , how many people search for ‘ christmas gifts ’ in july ?   but there ’s more to consider with search volume results :   search volume is not equal to search traffic .   just because a keyword gets a lot of searches does n’t mean it gets a lot of traffic ; i.e. not everyone clicks on the search results they see .   i know i do n’t , and i ’m sure you do n’t .   again , ahrefs illustrates this by comparing the search volume of two keywords : ‘ seo tips ‘ and ‘ submit website to search engines ‘ :   based on search volume , you ’d think that ‘ seo tips ’ would get twice as much search traffic than ‘ submit website to search engines ’ – but it does n’t .   in fact , ahrefs discovered that ‘ submit website to search engines ‘ gets 10x more traffic than ‘ seo tips ‘ :   and that ’s because most pages rank for more than one keyword – on average about 1000 longer - tail keywords . [ more on this later , in part 4 . ]   summary   search volume is always approximate   be careful of seasonal variations   each page has more than one keyword   competition   it ’s always good to know what the competition is for your keyword . if you remember the kwfinder example from above , it includes a list of ‘ competition ’ metrics for the top positions in the serps .   that ’s certainly one way of checking the competition , and it ’s a time - saver for you as everything is in one place . but if you want to make your own investigation , you can .   install and activate the free mozbar :   now , when you search google you should see information from mozbar in the serps :   let ’s take a look at these metrics :   page level authority – pa   the first score on the mozbar is pa ( page authority ) , and that ’s because it ’s the most important .   google does n’t rank sites … it ranks pages .   when you look at the serps for the search term ‘ wordpress themes ’ , you can see a lot of high pa scores . but there is one page that has a lower rating :   so , how does it rank on the first page ?   it ’s probably helped by the next factor .   domain authority – da   google loves ranking pages from major authority sites like wikipedia and amazon . some of the pages on these sites do have legitimate page authority as well , but often a page can get ranked in the top 10 just because of its domain authority .   when you evaluate the competition , look at the combination of domain authority ( da ) and page authority ( pa ) . in our example above , the pa=32 and the da=58 .   even so , it ’s still low on another factor .   sandwiched in between the pa and da on the mozbar is the links score .   let ’s look at an example :   for a more detailed view you can click on the link analysis option , which opens the moz link explorer tool :   not all links are equal , and those coming from high authority sites have more power than those from low authority sites .   do n’t get too hung up about links , just be aware they exist and some high powered links will help your cause .   content   the final consideration is how well - structured the content is for the keyword , often referred to as on - page seo .   click on one of the results to open its page , and then click on the ‘ page analysis ‘ icon in the mozbar :   now you can see the essential on - page elements :   a well - optimized page will usually have the keyword in some of the following :   url   page title   main heading ( h1 )   first paragraph of the page   page subheadings ( h2 / h3 etc . )   note : these are not all absolutely necessary . and you should n’t cram your keyword into those places . google ’s focus is on user experience , so keywords should be added only where it makes sense for the user .   you should also make some manual checks to see if the content has related keywords elsewhere on the page , and to check how useful the content is ; i.e. does it have images / video , references / links to authority sources , related subtopics , and internal links .   summary   expect to see some high authority sites like wikipedia and amazon in the top 10 .   look for weaker pages with low pa that you can target .   optimize your content naturally and build authority over time .   keyword difficulty score   most keyword research tools include a keyword difficulty score . we saw it earlier in kwfinder :   the idea behind this metric is to let you spot low - competition keywords that you can out - rank . unfortunately , each vendor calculates its keyword difficulty score differently , although most will involve the factors above like authority , links , and trust .   to illustrate the point , take a look at these three scores for the term ‘ wordpress themes ’ :   keyword tool keyword difficulty % score kwfinder 61.00 serpstat 78.23 semrush 63.78   overall evaluation   evaluating search volume and competition is essential , but it ’s also relative . when you start a new site , you start with zero domain authority . it takes time to build authority , but when you create more high - quality content , you ’ll gain more high - authority links . plus your page and domain authority will increase , too .   part 4 – sort into topics   so , now you have all these keywords what are you going to do with them ?   well the whole idea of keyword research is to find what content you can rank for . like we said earlier , what ’s the point of writing content if nobody is going to see it and read it .   in the bad old days , your next step would have been to stuff as many of your keywords as possible into your content . the reason for that was because google needed to know what your web page was about . and the best way was to keep repeating the keyword until it understood .   but now , you do n’t have to do that .   google has grown up . and it ’s become smarter .   when google introduced its hummingbird update in 2013 , it said that it wanted to understand the meaning behind search queries ( search intent ) rather than matching specific words to page content .   pages matching the meaning typically do better than pages matching just a few words .   for some keywords ( not all ) , google may prefer detailed content covering topics , rather than short content targeting individual keywords .   for example , previously you may have written four short blog posts :   how to upload a wordpress theme   how to install a wordpress theme   how to update a wordpress theme   how to delete a wordpress theme   but now you can write one detailed article :   everything you ever wanted to know about using wordpress themes   note : this is not always the case . it very much depends on the intent of the keyword . be sure to check serps to see what sort of content is ranking first . if google is ranking short posts that directly answer searcher intent , writing long - form content may not be the best approach .   write for topics , not keywords   do n’t worry . you can still use your keywords . it ’s just a case of sorting them into topics .   for instance , the term ‘ wordpress themes ’ is so vast you could dedicate a whole website to it . so you need to break it down into topics .   here i ’ve used some of the ‘ how to ’ questions from answer the public and divided them into three topics :   how to use and manage a wordpress theme how to use wordpress themes how to upload a wordpress theme how to install a wordpress theme how to install a wordpress theme manually how to update a wordpress theme how to delete a wordpress theme   how to customize a wordpress theme how to customize a wordpress theme how to edit a wordpress theme how to modify a wordpress theme how to change wordpress theme how to make a wordpress theme responsive how to change a wordpress theme name how to translate a wordpress theme   how to develop a wordpress theme how to develop a wordpress theme how to create wordpress themes how to create a wordpress theme from scratch how to design wordpress themes how to sell wordpress themes     this list is by no means exhaustive . it ’s a start . but now you have three topics geared towards to different audiences using ‘ informational search queries ’ . ( remember those from earlier ? )   wordpress users – those who only want to cover the essentials – starters   – those who only want to cover the essentials – starters wordpress customizers – those who like to dabble and tinker – intermediate   – those who like to dabble and tinker – intermediate wordpress developers – those who want to get serious – advanced   as you start writing the content for any of these topics you will naturally add more related keywords . that ’s good , and it ’s what google wants .   google is looking for the best answer , with the most relevant and detailed content .   conclusion   congratulations – you made it to the end !   take your time to go back and review each section . start working your way through the keyword research process , and remember to use keywords as a guide for your content topics , not as the be all and end all of your writing .   handpicked related posts to level up your seo :   disclosure : this post contains affiliate links . this means we may make a small commission if you make a purchase .',\n",

why not leverage the traffic of large blogs ?   for example , it is rare that your blog will ever get more traffic than sites like forbes , so in addition to posting on your blog , look to guest post on authoritative sites .   do n’t do it for the backlinks , do it for the branding .   danny wong   align yourself with other ambitious and influential bloggers . my career as a blogger has spanned nearly 5 years , and during that time , i ’ve been published on the huffington post , the next web , search engine journal , entrepreneur , and readwrite .   when you ally with more - established bloggers and many up - and - coming writers , you ’ll quickly recognize the power of collaboration and networking .   keeping bloggers in your niche in - the - know about your work means you ’ll always be top - of - mind with them whenever noteworthy opportunities come up . i have many writers to thank for helping me grow my career ; three worth mentioning are shane snow of contently who gave me the confidence to work with my first paying client , and ritika puri and brian honigman who frequently refer quality clients and projects my way .   admittedly , it has n’t been that much of an uphill battle to build a name for myself . and that all came organically after developing critical relationships with writers who loved my work after i showed it to them .   if you ’re just starting out as a blogger and want to get noticed quickly , you need to make yourself visible every day . to make this happen , you ’re going to have to include a variety of tactics , which could , at first , feel overwhelming . the secret is to make it a natural part of your day and to think of it as supporting one goal : visibility .   here ’s what i recommend :   spend 20 to 30 minutes a day curating articles that relate to your area of expertise . use a tool like buffer or hootsuite to schedule them over the next day or so in twitter .   get involved in some groups on linkedin and/or google+ . spend a half hour or so each week engaging with these groups . focus on helping others , not promoting yourself .   write guest blog posts for leading blogs in your industry . set a goal of publishing at least one guest post per month .   do n’t forget your own website . when people see you online , they ’ll come to check you out . make sure your site looks professional and shows off your skills . and make sure it ’s optimized for search .   at least once a week , post a valuable piece of content to your own blog . then share it on all your social channels .   one final tip : a great way to get your name on people ’s radar is to write an interview post like this one .   you ’ll quickly expand your network and develop relationship with recognized experts .   bonnie andrews   you are running the show – not your blog . you wear the pants . you ’re in the driver ’s seat .   so often i see bloggers who are letting their blogs take over , like the blog is some kind of living , breathing life form that ’s controlling them .   they feel stressed . they feel frustrated . they feel overwhelmed and they feel like a master to their blog instead of their blog being a servant in their online / blogging business . it ’s unreal how often bloggers want to give up , even when they ’re onto something great . so in short , do n’t give up and do n’t let your blog become your master .   keep it in a real perspective and think straight . this is you . this is your business and no one can take it away from you or make you fail outside of your permission .   if i could give one piece of advice to bloggers that would help them grow their online presence it would be to leverage their social media channels .   a lot of bloggers i work with think that once they have written their blog post , that ’s it .   if you are a blogger and you want to grow your online presence , you need to be sure you also promote your blog post after you hit publish .   you can do this a number of ways :   share your post with fans on social networks you are on   promote your blog post in communities such as triberr   notify your email list   include links in your email signature   if it is work related , post links within your companies intranet for employees to learn about   by taking this extra step , you can leverage your connections to get the word out about your latest blog post .   it is also important to remember to include links to your social media channels where you want readers to connect with you at . this way once they read your content , if they want to connect , you have made it easy for them to .   by promoting your blog post , not only can you increase your views , but build awareness on your knowledge on a particular topic and grow your online presence .   if i could give one piece of advice to bloggers that would help them stand out online it would be to network with other bloggers ( and write awesome content ) .   one of the fastest ways to stand out online is to write content people want to read . but how do you do that if you have a limited audience ? that ’s where networking comes into play .   by networking , not only can you get your content in front or more people , but if you network with the right people , you can gain more exposure just by having them mention you or share your content within their network of friends , fans and business associates .   one of the best ways to do this is to guest blog for other sites . some ways to do this are to use the contact form on a site you want to guest post for or to engage with them via their social media channels .   by doing this , you can open doors and also demonstrate to people who are not familiar with your work that you are a subject matter expert on a particular topic .   in doing this , you can not only get your name out there but stand out more in a crowded online world .   john paul aguiar – johnpaulaguiar.com   i would say it comes down to two things .   first , have a blog design that stands out and is different . if you visit enough blogs , they all start to look the same , same themes , same colors , it ’s boring .   instead , use a design and color scheme that no one has , whether they like it or not , they will remember it .   second , i would say “ write your content ” . that means , write original stuff , write stuff no one is writing and in a way no one else is writing it .   curation is a big thing online now and i see many bloggers doing it , to me i think it ’s a big mistake . referencing someone or something in a post is fine , but full curation is n’t good .   how can you stand out when you are mainly sharing other peoples stuff ?   write content in a way that only you can write , once you do that it will be very easy for you to get noticed and grow your presence online .   chris garrett   get to know the intersection of :   how you can help what people need / want what people find difficult to get help with how your approach is unique and better   if you can find something you can help with , that is in demand , and is under - served , then you will not just stand out but you will make a significant contribution to other people ’s lives .   now , do n’t get me wrong , i do not mean find something where there is no competition ! i mean get to know your specific target audience so you can help them the best . let them connect with you , let your personality and voice come through . use the benefit of your own experience while teaching . it ’s about them , but use what makes you “ you ” to reach them .   to give you an example , i am learning about the world of fiction writing from sean platt and johnny truant , even though there is a lot of information out there for aspiring authors . i feel they “ get me ” in regards my specific needs .   unlike other people who are giving storytelling advice , they are normal people who have discovered some effective systems , but they also have personality . they teach their readers to work hard , while they also demonstrably work very hard , and they tell their audience very clearly that “ build it and they will come ” is a mission bound to fail .   so they meet a need , in their own unique way , with their tried and tested systems . not everyone will resonate with them , and that is a good thing .   a good way to start to develop an audience is to comment on more established blogs in your niche — but only when you can add something meaningful to the conversation .   most blogging platforms will let you identify your website when you ’re commenting . if someone finds your comment of value , they will often click through to your site to find out more .   the trick here is not to get promotional ( such as adding a self - serving link to your articles in the comment ) or saying something meaningless , such as “ great post ! ” look at it as a way to add value to the blogger ’s post without stepping on toes .   perhaps you could pose another question or offer a different spin on the topic . make it a regular practice to seek out blogs to comment on .   i also like to comment often on industry blogs because they are widely read and many will see what you have to say , some even rate you as a commenter .   always keep this in mind … to me it is really simple , if you want to “ stand out ” in the social space , do what most others are not doing … actually be social when using social media 🙂 # ronr # h2h.   i think clarity is hugely important for bloggers .   and for me there are two types : clarity of purpose and clarity of execution .   clarity of purpose means knowing exactly who you ’re targeting with your blog , how you ’re helping them and why your blog is different to all the other blogs out there . too many bloggers do n’t know the answers to these basic questions and as a result they find it hard to stand out from the crowd .   clarity of execution means bringing this purpose to life with your blog so that new visitors know within seconds whether or not it ’s relevant to them , their needs and concerns . that clarity extends to your blog design , your tagline , your about page , your headlines – everything must resonate with your core purpose .   and you must learn to write clearly too . you ca n’t spread great ideas if you ca n’t successfully plant the seed in someone else ’s head ( a topic i write about here ) .   standing out means that others are easily able to bring you and your blog into clear focus . and without clarity of purpose and execution you ’ll remain a blur in the background forever .   for me the single biggest difference has been guest posting .   it ’s all about creating relationships with others , showing your expertise and becoming an authority in your niche .   when you have done some guest posting ( also on bigger blogs ) , it makes it easier to launch your own product later on .   this ( creating products ) will grow your audience and your authority even further .   be different than every other blogger out there . you can be different by picking a niche that no one else writes content on or deliver the content in a different way than someone else . my entire focus on my blog is social media tools .   although many people write about tools there was no one site that focussed only on tools . this helps your blog grow a lot quicker . if you do n’t stand out from the crowd it will a steeper hill you have to climb .   make your blog about your audience , not about you .   it ’s easy to find yourself thinking about what you want to say , what feels right to you , and what you want the blog to do for you , but here ’s the thing :   you do n’t matter . if you want to be successful , you have to set your ego aside and focus entirely on building what your audience needs and wants .   it ’s harder than it sounds . to help you get started , try this simple exercise :   write an entire blog post without using the word “ i. ” you ca n’t cheat by writing things like “ one might think … ” either . instead , relate every single point you have to make to the audience . make yourself invisible .   once you master the art of invisibility , you can start injecting your own colorful personality back into your posts . in the beginning though , make yourself as transparent as glass .   getting attention as a blogger today is tougher than a doorman at a london pub . that is to say , extremely tough and also quite a challenge .   i have used a few techniques to help expand my reach and get myself known since i started blogging , and i am quickly going to share some of my secrets with you .   one of the first things i did was to write something that included a lot of influencers in it . this is a trick that a lot of people will probably mention in this post , so i will move on to my next idea .   another great idea is to stand out from the crowd by branding yourself . in fact , quite recently i had a great podcast discussion with john paul agiuar on this very topic . he is a smart guy , so it is worth a listen .   so what exactly do i mean by branding yourself ?   here are a few ideas :   find a unique color scheme and a font or two , and a logo of course , that suit your brand .   use these on all of your images for social media and blog posts .   use the same image of you ( or your logo ) on all your social media accounts , email , gravitar etc .   also add your blog url to all images and videos on social media .   if you want some great role models for this kind of thing ( apart from myself of course ) check out rebekah radice , dustin stout and robert ryan . these guys are doing a great job of personal branding online .   although this may seem like something that will not get you very far , remember that not many people are doing this , or doing this well . but if branding works for coke , nike and mcdonalds , then it is certainly worth giving it a go !   a final note : if you need some help making awesome images to promote your brand , a great tool to use is canva .   start thinking seriously about your brand today and stand out from the crowd .   in order to build your presence online and stand out from all the other noise , be sure you are consistently delivering great content every single time you blog .   addressing your clients ’ needs , worries , and problems , while infusing a bit of your own personality is the perfect mixture for a stellar blog .   join a blogging group on linkedin or google plus so your blogs are seen by others and shared and commented on for increased exposure .   most importantly , tell a story – draw your readers in , do n’t just list five tips for this or that ; boring and it ’s probably been done before .   get started on google+ !   really , it will renew your blogging experience .   not only does the content you create get indexed by google , but the community on google+ will actual enable your content to be amplified and help it surface as search results .   you can create mini opt in lists of dedicated readers using google circles , and email them with your latest posts .   you will also have incredible conversations , get new ideas and the more you give , the more your future will be shaped by the network you form .   trust me , it will transform your online life as a blogger .   it is n’t just one thing , otherwise you wo n’t stand out . you need to do at least two things !   first create the best content you can that adds value to your readers lives and business . then you need to build and optimize online distribution networks for your content including email , social and search .   eric enge   seek extreme differentiation .   “ me - too ” content is not going to cut it .   if you search on this query in google : intitle:”how to make french toast ” you get more than 30,000 results in google . that means that there are more than 30,000 web pages with “ how to make french toast ” in the title tag .   google does not need any more such articles . neither do the audiences you are trying to reach on social media or the web at large .   find ways to create fantastic new content .   if you need to cover a me - too like topic , find a way to bring a new spin to it , add some new humor to it , share it on a new platform , or address one specific vertical aspect of it in a way that others have not done before .   differentiation is critical to survival … and thriving on line .   one thing that i would always recommend to people is to start searching for like - minded people right away .   build your tribe by connecting yourself to people that are in your target market .   you can not make it to the top by yourself ; it ’s the people around you that will help you get there , and you helping them .   this is not an individual quest for victory its locking arms with the people you have made relationships with and helping each other succeed .   you can do this by helping promote other people ’s posts and events , retweeting and re - sharing . people remember that . people also remember someone who extends kindness and helpfulness without expecting anything in return .   do what you can to be a servant so you can eventually be served yourself .   danny iny – mirasee   there are a lot of different things that bloggers can do to stand out online – but the first and most important one is to focus on one niche .   when you dilute your message by writing about different subjects in different areas , your reader ’s do n’t know what to think . this is okay later on after you ’ve built a reputation and have strong relationships with your readership and the broader community – but in the beginning people need to know what to expect from you , and by narrowly focusing on one specific niche you can build yourself into a position of authority much more quickly .   pick something you ’re good at , that interests you , and that you have good reason to believe will interest a lot of other people as well .   cyrus shepard   i have two pieces of advice to bloggers to help them grow their presence and stand out online .   1 . the first would be to create something unique and useful that no one in their space has done before . for example , i am a bicyclist and although there are bicycling route sites aplenty online , they are confusing and hard to navigate , so i might create the most amazing bicycle routes in seattle and rank them by difficulty , elevation , length , popularity , etc . it ’s usually not very hard to find something to create that ’s better than everything else out there – the hard part is actually putting in the work to make it .   2 . getting involved with other bloggers , being social , is an essential part of the equation . bloggers and people who comment on your blog are people themselves who like to engage , and these are the very same people you want to promote your work . if you are a finance blogger , help out other finance bloggers ! leave comments , link to their posts , say hi to them at conferences .   blogging is a lot like real life , except when you do it right you can connect with people in the world even when you are sleeping .   pauline cabrera   my biggest piece of advice is do n’t be generic . do n’t just become a “ me too ” blog . you need to stand out in order to get noticed . here ’s how :   build a blog with a memorable design . choose your style and colors , and be consistent with it .   be creative with your content formatting but make sure they ’re easy on the eyes .   use unique and captivating images . if you use stock photos , at least make an effort to spruce them up .   be passionate about your subject . be specific . be personal . share examples , your experiences or your own story .   offer something fresh . do n’t just post what everyone else is posting .   create a great impact and make people say , “ oh , i have to bookmark this blog ! ”   adrienne smith   my best piece of advice that has worked extremely well for me is to leave genuine , thoughtful and helpful comments on other people ’s posts .   trust me when i say they ’ll notice you .   i know people say this all the time to not get in a hurry and leave short comments but to actually take the time to read their posts and leave a very well thought out comment . they give that advice for a reason .   it ’s the best way to get noticed by others and then of course be sure to share their posts on the social media sites . i ’ve had more people approach me because they have read my comments and were very impressed that i really took the time to leave good ones on every post i visit .   i still believe commenting is a great way to build relationships with other bloggers and i ’ve had a lot of success with that .   niall devitt   that ’s a great question – however i do n’t believe there are any silver bullets .   for me , it all comes down to being consistent , growing your online presence takes time , patience and lots of hard work . figure out your niche , create and promote great content , identify influencers and build your network . learn and repeat .   from what i ’ve seen , many give up before they get there , while a few stick at it long enough to ultimately learn how to really stand out .   one of the most important pieces of advice i can give someone about growing their online presence or simply stand out is to choose a niche or topic that they simply love and is timeless . they should treat blogging like a serious business instead of a ‘ money magnet ’ .   many times , people start a blog because it ’s a ‘ good market ’ and while building the blog , they feel burned out because they simply do n’t have the passion and the drive to write for that topic .   blogging is a career and if you want to stand out , it has to be something that you love writing and love to share . that is how you can truly stand out and most important be yourself .   there is a big debate about shutting down blog comments . copyblogger did it . mitch joel did it . jay baer is considering it . the common thing , you ’ll notice , is they are all well - established bloggers with lots of readers and subscribers .   when you begin , though , no one knows about you , which makes a community extremely important . not only will a community read and share your content , they ’ll help you grow your network . to do that , you want to respond to people when they do comment on your blog . you want to find other bloggers with like - minded content and go comment on and share their content . write guest posts for blogs that have a similar audience to the one you want to grow .   all of these things take time , resources , and a little elbow grease . but building a community will be one of the most important things you do to grow your online presence . you ’ll obtain new social media followers , you ’ll discover new thinking , and you ’ll grow your readers and subscribers .   in order to stand out online , having a constant presence on it is a must . and the perfect way to start - off your journey to success is by building friendships with individuals who love writing as much as you do : bloggers .   identifying and outreaching prominent bloggers in their niche , and regularly posting comments on their websites , can help you out tremendously . after a while of them constantly reading your comments and you analyzing the type of content they usually post , you can reach out to those bloggers and show them your content and invite them to post it in their online channels .   bloggers are great influencers that every writer should try to obtain . once they read your work and like it , you ’ll more than likely be contacted often by them to write more blog content , which will be of great benefit for you . once you have that constant internet presence , you ’ll stand - out and make a name for yourself !   do n’t ever forget about your friends once you start working with well - known individuals , as your pals will always be the ones by your side not matter what ( even if you write a mediocre article ) . they ’ll always support you and assist you in spreading your message !   be authentic , and not just with your triumphs , your failures too .   people just want to know there ’s a human behind the site .   the more transparent you are , the more your audience will connect with you . the web is not just about websites with content , but the personality of the people connected to them .   i think many bloggers hit publish and wait for traffic to magically appear . this is n’t going to happen .   you need to actively promote your content via social networks and being active on social media . social media + blogging + working hard = the “ magic ” to blog traffic .   to accelerate visibility for your blog , start a hangout on air show around the topic of your business blog .   doing a live video show is the fastest way to get seen , be heard , build trust and connect with your ideal blog readers .   focus on your primary topic and invite guest experts who complement your expertise .   you will set yourself apart fast by adding a playlist of your videos on youtube and repurposing the audio on a site like soundcloud and itunes . always include a call to action for your audience to subscribe to get blog updates at the beginning and end of your show .   my single best advice to new bloggers who want to succeed would be to become regular readers of as many other bloggers in their space as they can , and look for opportunities to create genuine relationships with those writers .   these are the people whom you can learn from , who will be providing valuable information that you can then share to your own growing follower base , and whom it will mean the world to you when they notice you and begin to share some of your content out to their followers .   if i could only give one piece of advice to a blogger trying to go big and get out there it would be to make something freaking awesome that answers a question in your industry , or that people in your niche are searching for .   this gives you trust and authority and they will surely follow you the next time they are looking for information in your industry .   for example , we work with a client who sells arcade games . not the biggest player out there , just a local guy with a few hundred arcade systems . the other week we created an animated gifographic on the evolution of arcade games and it went pretty big on the first day i put it out there .   it got on the home page of wired and make use of , among a bunch of gaming sites . so now all of these gamers that had no idea who m&p was now know who they are . here ’s the post on wired .   lyuba ellingson   develop relationships online with people who are already famous with your target demographic but do n’t do what you do .   offer them something very helpful like guest content on a topic their audience is interested in and you are an expert on .   make sure to provide a lot of value . go above and beyond . once the guest post goes live , be sure to thank your new acquaintance for the opportunity and express interest in doing more .   there is no better and quicker way to stand out online than to be promoted with someone with influence .   walter blake knoblock   i ’ve got over 100k followers , most of them on twitter , and i think a large reason for that is engagement , but everybody says that and , of course , if you engage with your followers and say smart stuff it will work . but , beyond that , i make sure that whenever i do something noteworthy , speaking at a college , publishing a new book , etc … , i put out the word to everybody i know .   a good pr list is gold .   you can find some great success in growing your online presence and blog with pinterest when you create an amazing feature visual with a great headline in it , similar to a magazine cover .   by producing featured visuals that are beautiful and “ pinnable ” on your blog you can receive hundreds , and even thousands of more shares . but you have to create something that pinners on pinterest can pin .   the main challenge that some blogs do n’t incorporate a pin it button on their website to help encourage the spread of their blog content on pinterest , even though it may have a great feature visual . pinterest is n’t just a visual tool for sharing , many marketers and bloggers also use it as a book marking tool so that they can reference and read the material later on .   i wrote a piece about how to search optimize your pins on pinterest . people find it on my blog , and then pin it and then later on , other people repin it , and somehow it resurfaces again on another pinner ’s account weeks later .   the interesting thing is that a pin has a half - life that ’s thousands of times longer than a facebook status or tweet , according to venturebeat .   by being able to put a pin it button , and create an amazing visual that ’s relevant to my specific audience , which is marketers and small businesses , my pin that promotes pinterest search optimization has been repinned over 450 times .   this is the power of pinterest for helping you grow your online presence .   get involved . join conversations , start conversations .   growing your online presence requires you to not only put out great content , but to also connect and engage post publish . joining the community establishes influence and credibility , key to growing your online presence .   larry kim – mobilemonkey   try enlisting the help of other influential folks .   there ’s a few ways to do this . for example , you can take an interest in their content by commenting and reposting the content that they share , and even try meeting them in real life at industry conferences .   another approach is to create amazing content that will get the attention of influencers , since they ’re always on the lookout for awesome stuff to share with their audiences .   connect with other bloggers in your niche .   if you want to grow your online presence , than you need to start building connections with other bloggers in your niche . this is how i built relationship with adam connell ; i first dropped him an email and asked if he could link to one of my blog posts in his next weekly roundup . he not only linked to my post but also did a few guest posts .   since then he has featured me on his blog quite a few times ( thanks adam ) .   the trick to growing your audience online is actually counterintuitive from what you might expect .   the commonly slung around tricks , tactics and strategies which prey on the law of large numbers are yielding lower and lower returns .   today ’s connected generation consumer wants a human relationship with the brands they do business with and relationships start with trust .   my one piece of advice to bloggers looking to grow their online presence is value the trust built between you and your audience above all else .   no matter what industry , topic , niche blog about , focus on authenticity , transparency and honesty .   all of which lead to trust .   this may come across as being a little cheesy , but i think the best advice i can give to any aspiring blogger is to be yourself .   i see many bloggers saying something is amazing just to get an affiliate commission , whether they have used it or not . i also see many people simply mimicking others because they feel that it will get them readers .   if you want to set yourself apart from the crowd , be yourself . if you do not like something , say so . if you love something even when everyone else hates it , do not be afraid to say you love it and explain why .   at the end of the day , you want to have a unique voice and not follow the herd in order to be accepted . some people will love you for it , some people will hate you for it , though at least you will be unique .   blogging is something you should be passionate about . that is why i encourage all bloggers to speak up and share their opinion rather than conforming to the opinions of others because they feel they should .   jimmy rodriguez – 3dcart   find blogs that have a large subscriber base and accept guest posts . build a list of the ones that are a good match for your expertise , research their current content and develop a list of topics that would be a good fit for their audience .   reach out offering your articles as a guest writer , provide references for the quality of your work as a link to existing articles on your own blog .   guest blogging will help you establish yourself as an authority , and followers of these blogs like your articles , they will organically approach your blog looking for additional content .   land high - quality links with the help of haro .   links acquired from top - notch industry sites are always beneficial for your business . besides an seo value that those links bring to your site , they also help to grow your brand awareness and trustworthiness . however , not each and every business can afford to hire an seo agency to make things happen . and that ’s where haro comes in . haro connects experts across various industries and journalists to create really engaging news stories that will be published on the very best sites in your niche .   here ’s how you can take advantage of haro :   register on the haro site and sign up to relevant to your business streams of queries that will be sent 3 times per day directly in your inbox . review haro journalist ’s source requests and pick up those that are relevant to your expertise . craft your perfect pitch that will include a quick summary of your response structured with 3 - 5 bullet points .   you can also subscribe to streams that are n’t relevant to your current business but still relevant to your expertise and send your answers to them as well . in that case , you ’re doubling your chances to generate more links from media outlets .   the easiest way to stand out in the crowd ( and quickly too ) is to target long tail keywords . and when i say “ long tail ” i mean extremely long tail ( 7 + words ) .   the logic behind this approach is that these keywords are vastly underserved in the serps , and people who do search for them need to settle for generic answers to their specific problems .   so , by deliberately targeting these keywords you will quickly build a loyal fanbase , a group of people who found value in what you wrote and who ’ll want to spread the word about it .   they ’ll become your “ 1000 true fans ” and then you take it from there .   note : oftentimes these extremely long phrases will appear as “ zero search volume ” terms .   however , that does n’t mean they get zero searches per month ( how did the keyword tools pick them up then ? ) ; it simply means that keyword tools do n’t have enough data on them and that ’s why their search volume is zero .   it ’s actually not and what ’s more , extremely long tails tend to come in tight clusters , groups of keywords all driven by the same search intent , but worded slightly differently . ,   so , optimize your article around one such key phrase and you ’ll often scoop up dozens of others .   remember , they do n’t have zero search volume , but they do have zero competition . 🙂   a good example is my jasper ai review where i target a long tail phrase “ how can i get jasper ai free trial ” within my content . ahrefs shows it has 0 search volume , but my gsc report strongly disagrees showing me over 200 impressions and ~6 clicks per day for “ jasper ai free trial ” cluster of queries . i took a shot and it paid off .   over to you   phew . we ’ve shared a lot of advice with you today .   now , it ’s time to start implementing what you ’ve learned . the best way to proceed is to pick out the answer that resonates with you the most , and start experimenting .   be sure to bookmark this so you can come back to it and work through the advice in other answers .   finally , i ’d like to say a huge thank you for all of the experts above that took the time to take part .',\n",

              " 'link building is not illegal ( or inherently bad ) with matt cutts . an interview with matt cutts , google distinguished engineer , and head of the google webspam team .   eric enge : there are people who think link building is illegal now . is link building illegal ?   matt cutts : no , link building is not illegal .   eric enge : really ?   matt cutts : it ’s funny because there are some types of link building that are illegal , but it ’s very clear - cut : hacking blogs , that sort of thing is illegal .   eric enge : of course , people are using the term illegal in an imprecise way . so do n’t be literal as an engineer with me now . they ’re thinking that google says all link building is bad .   “ no , not all link building is bad . ”   matt cutts : no , not all link building is bad . the philosophy that we ’ve always had is if you make something that ’s compelling then it would be much easier to get people to write about it and to link to it . and so a lot of people approach it from a direction that ’s backward . they try to get the links first and then they want to be grandfathered in or think they will be a successful website as a result .   their goal should really be to make a fantastic website that people love and tell their friends about and link to and want to experience . as a result , your website starts to become stronger and stronger in the rankings .   eric enge : i always liken this to doing marketing the way it used to be done , right ? businesses always tried to create the best product , the best value , of the best something . then they would find a way to promote it . then promotion becomes easy . for example , you can even do a press release and it may well attract attention and cause people to write about it .   matt cutts : right . so the link from a press release will probably not count , but if that press release convinces an editor or a reporter to write a story about it , and that ’s an editorial decision , then if that newspaper links to your website as a result of that editorial decision to write a story , it does n’t matter whether it started or was sparked by a press release or it was started by an email that you sent . it ’s still someone making a decision to cover it .   “ … it is true that a lot of seo is now circling back around to good old fashioned marketing . ”   going back to something that you said before we started the interview , a lot of seo has been focused on technical matters and very highly specific ways to configure your website and stuff like that . there are best practices , and you need to make sure you get the basics right , but it is true that a lot of seo is now circling back around to good old fashioned marketing .   there are lots of ways to do marketing and do it well ; there are lots of different ways to get peoples ’ attention and to get traction . and the more creative you are or the better the experience is with your website , the more likely you are to be successful . but in a lot of ways , if you think like a good marketer and think about what will appeal to people , you will find your job as an seo and getting links or trying to build your links will be easier as well .   eric enge : one great way to build links in my vision is to build strong twitter , facebook , google+ presences . build strong , engaged , followings and then create great content and you push that out and then that audience will likely share it , and start doing other things that cause visibility and help it rank . that ’s a cool way to do link building .     matt cutts : absolutely , i completely agree . if you take that big picture view in which you ’re really doing marketing , one of the ways to get the word out is to have a devoted following . musicians could have a mailing list or people could follow you on twitter or facebook or google+ or any social outlet .   i firmly support the idea that people should have a diversified way of reaching their audience . so if you rely only on google , that might not be as strong of an approach compared to having a wide variety of different avenues by which you can reach people and drive them to your website or whatever your objective is .   eric enge : yes , and as you said in our last interview before this one :   “ by doing things that help build your own reputation , you are focusing on the right types of activity . those are the signals we want to find and value the most anyway . ”   you can argue about how good google is about detecting a particular signal today , or whether a given signal is noisy or not , but over time google ’s capabilities in these areas will continue to get better and better .   “ there are certainly people who are widely known on the web , who have a great reputation , who are experts , who are authorities , who everybody listens to or trusts . ”   matt cutts : it ’s definitely the case that we will improve over time at assessing the authority and reputation and all those characteristics of authors and people in general and people on the web . there are certainly people who are widely known on the web , who have a great reputation , who are experts , who are authorities , who everybody listens to or trusts .   somebody like nate silver for example who talks about elections . if he talks about elections , you want to take what he says seriously . you might disagree with him , but you ’ll probably pay attention to it .   there ’s the same sort of thing with , for example , danny sullivan on search engines . you want to be one of those people because that ’s useful in and of itself , and over time you can certainly expect that search engines will try and do a better job of saying this person or this website is an authority on this topic and therefore when they write about it , it ’s something that users are more likely to be interested in .   eric enge : another concept is the notion of syndicating great content . there are many different ways to do that . you can take content that you ’ve published on your own website , and you can distribute that , which has its own issues . some businesses have really strong fundamental reasons for doing that .   i know one business that has a massive content syndication deal with yahoo ! for example , and they get more traffic from their syndication than they do from search . but it turns out they have the same content on their site as well .     this notion of syndicating great content seems to be another very valid way of building links , particularly if you ’re getting on authoritative sites .   matt cutts : syndication can be a valid way to either increase your reputation or to drive traffic and potentially to get more links . the main caution that i would add is that there are some mechanical things that you should pay attention to and try to make sure that you get right .   “ so if you are also publishing the article on your site , you want to try and do these mechanical things so you are still seen as the original author . ”   things like rel = canonical help . embedding a link within the text of the article itself never hurts . ideally , you ’d want to insist on some sort of attribution on the syndicated page . you can use authorship markup . so if you are also publishing the article on your site , you want to try and do these mechanical things so you are still seen as the original author .   or , see if you can make sure that the article publishes first on your website . give it a few hours or days or however much of a window you can , and then syndicate it onto another site . if you think about it , search engines are not psychic . they have to use signals and heuristics to make their best guess about what the best website is or who wrote content in the first place .   “ the more signals or hints or indications you can give us , the easier job it will be for search engines to make sure that the attribution and the reputation flow in the correct direction so that you enjoy the benefits of syndication but you also do well on search . ”   the more signals or hints or indications you can give us , the easier job it will be for search engines to make sure that the attribution and the reputation flow in the correct direction so that you enjoy the benefits of syndication but you also do well on search .   eric enge : right . of course , a much cleaner way of dealing with this , is to create content for syndication and not publish it on your own site . you can have a simple one - page piece of content that lists key resources for people looking for information on a specific topic .   another very popular tactic that people like to use is guest posting . frankly though , more often than not , when i see guest posting , it ’s actually not good stuff . but , i would say that creating a very high - quality article and getting it published on a truly authoritative site that has a lot of editorial judgment is still a good thing .   matt cutts : those are certainly good criteria to keep in mind . the challenge with guest posting is that people have different conceptions about what it means . and so for a lot of people , a guest post is something that a fantastic author has thought deeply about , labored over , polished , put a lot of work into and then publishes on a highly reputable domain name .   posts like that can be a great way to get your name out there , to build your reputation , to make yourself more well - known , potentially build links or traffic or help with your seo .   the problem is that if we look at the overall volume of guest posting we see a large number of people who are offering guest blogs or guest blog articles where they are writing the same article and producing multiple copies of it and emailing out of the blue and they will create the same low - quality types of articles that people used to put on article directory or article bank sites .   “ if people just move away from doing article banks or article directories or article marketing to guest blogging and they do n’t raise their quality thresholds for the content , then that can cause problems . ”   if people just move away from doing article banks or article directories or article marketing to guest blogging and they do n’t raise their quality thresholds for the content , then that can cause problems . on the one hand , it ’s an opportunity . on the other hand , we do n’t want people to think guest blogging is the panacea that will solve all their problems .   eric enge : in the opposite direction , when i advise people on how to accept a guest post , i give very simple criteria . first , i want them to really only work with people who have really strong social presences because it ’s a measure of what they ’ve done to build their authority .   and then the metric that i give them is if you have to ask them to share it on their social sites , then you do n’t want the article , because that means they ’re there to trade on your authority rather than they gave you their best stuff .   matt cutts : that ’s a good way to look at it . there might be other criteria too , but certainly , if someone is proud to share it , that ’s a big difference than if you ’re pushing them to share it .   eric enge : of course , it is important to look at this in the other direction in guest posting . you should only submit articles where the quality is high enough , and the site it is going on is authoritative enough that you would be proud to share it on your own social media accounts .   there ’s also the notion of giving and getting interviews . if you are able to interview people with recognized authority and publish that on your own site , that ’s good content . it ’s also great if you can get interviewed by people , and have that published on their site with a link back to yours . those would seem like very good signals as well . of course , the quality of the content matters , and where it is published counts for a lot here too .   “ … interviews can be a fantastic way to build awareness of your brand and to generate and distribute insights . ”   matt cutts : yes , absolutely . it ’s interesting that you mentioned that because interviews can be a fantastic way to build awareness of your brand and to generate and distribute insights . it ’s funny because if you think about it , the entire podcasting industry is often based around this idea of doing interviews or even just people in conversations .   somebody like kevin smith has something he calls the smodcast which is just him talking with friends . he has been able to more or less make a living at just doing tours where he goes around and does his smodcast in an auditorium .   criteria that come to mind are , “ who are you talking to ? ” , or “ how interesting is the conversation ” ? the beauty of an interview or a podcast for something like that is if you ’re not interesting , people wo n’t tune in . or they might tune in at first but they ’ll tune out . it ’s a self - limiting phenomenon . you ca n’t just do interviews with everybody forever if you ’re always giving or getting boring interviews .     there ’s a little bit of reinforcement that helps force you to either be interesting or say interesting things or think hard about how to make something compelling .   eric enge : you ’ve had rel = author tagging for a while and people talk a lot about author rank or author authority . you made a comment back in october that :   “ i think if you look further out in the future and look at something that we call social signals or authorship or whatever you want to call it , in ten years , i think knowing that a really reputable guy – if dan has written an article , whether it ’s a comment on a forum or on a blog – i would still want to see that . so that ’s the long - term trend . ”   similarly eric schmidt said in the new digital age :   “ within search results , information tied to verified online profiles will be ranked higher than content without such verification , which will result in most users naturally clicking on the top ( verified ) results . the true cost of remaining anonymous , then , might be irrelevance . ”   basically , as an author you should think about how you develop and build your authority . you should measure things to see how you are doing . some ideas for this are :   how much engagement does your content get ?   try to develop relationships so you can post on authoritative sites .   the inverse is true too , do n’t publish on crappy sites .   where you write , and who you ’re trying to address , i would argue , is as important as what content you contribute .   “ … you make a very good point that the outlets and the responsiveness of those outlets is a good way to get an idea of how other people think about you . ”   matt cutts : while it remains the case that you always want to think about what you ’re saying and make sure that that ’s interesting and of use to people , you make a very good point that the outlets and the responsiveness of those outlets is a good way to get an idea of how other people think about you .   just to switch to an analogy from email , google has something called a priority inbox and we look at things like how often you reply to people and how fast you reply , versus do you always archive something , an email that somebody sent , or never even read it .   the priority inbox can start to get an idea of what is important to you . it might not know that this person is your boss , but it sees that you always respond within 5 minutes . it takes some of those signals and ends up with a pretty good assessment of which emails really matter .   you really want to think about , how do i make sure that in an seo sense , i ’m in somebody ’s priority inbox ? that i matter to them ? that i ’m relevant to them ? that i can give them something of use ? that they find me of value ?   if those are the sorts of things you ’re thinking about , that will be really useful because you ’ll tend not to bore people or be pushing for favors when people are a little leery of doing that . that can be a good attitude to approaching life in general . how can you add value to anybody else ’s life ?   eric enge : do you still believe that these types of considerations , i.e. the authority that people demonstrate online , will become a ranking factor ?   matt cutts : i would concentrate on the stuff that people write , the utility that people find in it , and the amount of times that people link to it . all of those are ways that implicitly measure how relevant or important somebody is to someone else .   “ links are still the best way that we ’ve found to discover that , and maybe over time social or authorship or other types of markup will give us a lot more information about that . ”   links are still the best way that we ’ve found to discover that , and maybe over time social or authorship or other types of markup will give us a lot more information about that .   we ’ll always keep chasing after the ideal world in which the search engines do what you would intuitively expect and bring you the best answer , whether it be from someone who is a friend of yours or someone who is an expert in the field or some completely different serendipitous author or person that you did n’t know about before , but they can really help with the information you need at that moment .   eric enge : right . so as always we could speculate until we ’re blue in the face as to what signals are driving ranking at the moment , but you should n’t necessarily get so wrapped up in that as monitoring the signals yourself to see whether or not you ’re getting good reinforcement for what you ’re doing .   matt cutts : yes . if your emails are getting replies , if people are replying to you on twitter or facebook , if you ’re getting good traction on your endeavors , that usually means you ’re moving in the right direction . if people suddenly go radio silent or you ’re not getting traction , that ’s a good time to step back and do an assessment and see if there ’s something that ’s missing in your approach or something that you could hone in order to resonate with your audience .   eric enge : right . so even if you are currently tracking signals that matter not at all to google , but they ’re really strong signals of the degree that you matter to people , you ’re probably also sending off the signals that google does take into consideration .   matt cutts : that ’s a reasonable way to look at it . if you ’re always trying new things , whatever your criteria is , and if you ’re making forward progress on those goals , you ’re often showing the signs of making progress in other areas well . it would n’t surprise me if in the process of setting and making progress on and achieving your goals you end up also getting traction , reputation as a person , as an individual , as an author , as an expert , as someone on the web and potentially someone in search engines as well .   eric enge : thank you , matt .   matt cutts : always fun to talk .   about matt   matt cutts joined google as a software engineer in january 2000 . before google , he was working on his ph.d. in computer graphics at the university of

              " 'vlog guide : how to start a successful vlog in 2021 . how to start a successful vlog : 10 tips + 10 examples   vlog . the word was coined in the year 2000 , which stands for either video blog or video log , and in 2021 is now ubiquitous . everyone is vlogging these days , and everyone wants their vlog to become big . here ’s how to start a successful vlog :   starting your own vlog is harder than it looks , but with the right focus , preparation , and equipment , there ’s no reason you ca n’t become a successful vlogger in 2021 .   in this post , we offer 10 tips on how to start a successful vlog , as well as 8 examples of awesome vloggers from youtube and tiktok who started it on their own to become legitimate vlog successes .   if you visit youtube in 2021 , you can easily look up a long list of influencers , streamers , and your average , regular people , who have a ton of video content being shared with the online world .   but one thing that all of these vloggers have in common is that they all have thousands , and in some cases , even millions , of subscribers .   and while this is great for celebrities and influencers , if you ’re like me , these numbers have probably left you wondering how you too can build a similar - sized vlog community on youtube or another channel , with just as many subscribers , likes , comments , and overall popularity .   so with that in mind , we have crafted the following guide to help you launch your very own vlog and to help get you started on your way to effervescent vlogging stardom .   if you are ready to create an awesome & super successful vlog , then it ’s time to jump right in !   start your vlog today :   step 1 : know what you ’re talking about , and who ’s listening   your first step into the vlog life should be to determine what your interests are , and whether your target audience is interested in listening to them .   defining your vlog topics to suit your audience will give you the tone , style , and even the language that you ’ll need to use to help your content connect with your audience before starting your vlog . basically , learning about your audience will help you determine the language you should be using in your videos .   step 2 : identify your target audience   as i ’ve mentioned , once you ’ve really worked to narrow down your topics , you ’ll need to get to know who you want to be talking to , or the people that are going to be interested in what you have to say .   this is referred to as niching down , which is essentially finding your target audience and narrowing down the core problems they face , which , in turn , will allow you to offer them the information , products , or services that they actually want and need .   so , as an example , let ’s just say that you ’re planning on starting a vlog about personal fitness , where you plan on sharing information about nutrition and keeping yourself in shape .   in order to create vlog content that your audience will actually want to watch , you ’re going to need to learn about the types of problems these people face on a daily basis .   by understanding the problems your audience members are currently facing , you ’ll be able to craft your content in response to their needs , enabling your vlog to become a trusted source of information to your viewers .   for this , marketers typically create buyer personas , which are semi - fictional representations of your potential viewers . these are then used to learn more about how you can create video content your audience will love .   step 3 : build a unique and catchy vlog brand   armed with the most epic concept , your next step is to start building your vlog brand and vlog channel .   unlike companies that produce and sell actual products , the only thing you ’re selling is you .   therefore , there are three key things you should be considering at this stage , which include :   your vlog channel ’s name , which needs to be unique , but still relatable to your industry . your vlog logo , which should be simple enough easily fit in a small youtube icon , while also being memorable . your internal branding for vlogging videos , which will be used to present your content any time you upload a video . think of this as the credits , or other pertinent information that will help brand your videos as your own .   most importantly , you need to start building your brand on social media by interacting with other influencers , building your audience , and getting the word out about your content .   the fact is that if you want your vlog to be successful , you ’ll need to gain followers on almost every digital channel there is . this includes being active on social media , as well as your own blog and the blogs of other influencers in your industry .   in the end , the more people that you can get your brand in front of , the better it will be in terms of future growth .   step 4 : determining which channels you ’re going to use for vlogging   in today ’s digital landscape , there are literally dozens of platforms that you can use to host your vlog content . for instance , you might want to host your videos directly on your own personal wordpress website , or you might choose to post your vlog content solely to your youtube channel .   regardless of the platform you choose , it ’s important to be promoting your content on the channel where your target audience is already hanging out .   so , for instance , let ’s say that you ’re planning on creating a vlog about video gaming .   because of the fact that video gamers are known to spend a lot of time on youtube , watching videos of other people playing , it would be wise of you to post your vlog content on youtube , where you already know that a large number of your potential viewers are already spending their time .   step 5 : have the right vlogging equipment , and practice with it   sometimes , it seems like youtubers are streaming directly from their pcs , using built - in mics and webcams .   while you can certainly start out with these types of basic , built - in recording equipment , in order to become a successful video blogger , who posts high - quality videos , you ’re going to need a lot more than a built - in mic and camera on your laptop .   in fact , most popular vloggers use dedicated recording devices , or even their own smartphones , to record their videos .   you ’d actually be surprised at how many famous vloggers use their smartphones as their recording devices , which today can shoot and record in ultra high - quality .   so , either way , if you ’re serious about your videos , you ’ll need these three things :   a fantastic smartphone , with a camera capable of recording in high - resolution good video editing software , that gives you full control over your final product . lighting equipment , if you really want to get serious about creating high - quality videos .   then , once you have your recording setup , you should take the time to get familiar with it , and then , by embracing the fun of learning about your recording equipment , you can get started making and publishing videos to your first vlog !   step 6 : brainstorm relevant , fun content   everything so far has built up to this , but the key point is that you need to get to work brainstorming content that your audience is actually going to want to watch .   vlog video content should always be fun , engaging , and most importantly , relevant to your audience .   improvisation can be good sometimes , but you should never rely on it as your go - to when filming videos . instead , think about your vlog topics ahead of time , do your research , and have your vlogs planned out in advance .   of course , you should also make sure to find the right time for publishing your youtube videos .   in the end , the key to creating engaging content is to craft your topics around the problems and issues that your audience members routinely face .   then , by providing them with solutions to their problems via your video content , you ’ll be able to almost guarantee that people will be interested in what you have to say .   step 7 : craft your first episode   now that you ’ve brainstormed your vlog topics and have done your research , it ’s time to craft an actual episode for your vlog !   one of the most important elements , besides your actual footage , is your introduction .   whether animated or filmed in real life , this is the part of your vlog that ’s either going to hook your audience or have them scrolling past without even giving you a second thought .   therefore , be sure to make a good impression by presenting to your audience who you are , what they ’re about to learn or witness in the video , and exactly why they should tune in .   the “ why ” itself should quickly and easily explain the solution to the viewer ’s problem . so for example , similar to this marketing idea , a good first vlog episode might explain to your viewer why they should follow your vlog .   the key is to immediately offer the benefits the viewer will get by watching your vlog post .   your intro should also present any branding materials you may , including your brand name , catch - phrase , or logo add to your video . consistently integrating these brand elements will also help make it easier for your viewers to associate the information they ’re learning with your brand in the future .   when presenting your branding in your vlogs , video overlays are going to be needed to help you achieve this . for this , you ’re going to want to use a high - quality video making tool , which can be an essential tool to the success of any vlog .   finally , another important element of your vlog channel content is going to be the outro of your videos .   rather than just saying goodbye and having the screen fade to black , use your outro as a chance to remind your audience how they can further connect with you . and do n’t forget to invite them to engage with you by leaving feedback in the comments , sharing the video with their friends , or by subscribing to future episodes .   step 8 : marketing your vlog   once you ’ve learned about your audience , and have started & crafted a vlogging brand that addresses their core needs and values , you ’re ready to start pumping out content and working to build your online presence .   but do n’t fool yourself ; you ca n’t expect to go from zero followers to a million overnight . in fact , it ’s probably going to take you weeks , months , and maybe even years before you reach a million followers .   but the point is that you need to work at marketing your vlog , which means promoting your content and being active on all social media channels , including facebook , youtube , instagram , twitter , and tiktok . consider using boosted ’s promo video maker to create short promo clips to promote your vlog channel .   step 9 : earn money as a vlogger influencer   finally , once you ’ve gained a bit of popularity and have built up your vlog ’s audience , you might want to start thinking about the ways that you can monetize your blog in order to start earning a bit of extra money .   there are many ways that vloggers can turn a profit , which includes selling products directly to their audience , or by promoting affiliate products , which are only a few of the ways a vlog can be used to generate profits . here ’s a fun list of 10 popular vloggers to check out ( and check out our own list below ! ) .   step 10 : growing your network   with your first vlog channel episodes published , unfortunately , the hard work does n’t quite end there .   in fact , it ’s vital to remember that networking , marketing , and promoting your vlog is an on - going , continuous effort , that is , of course , if you want to be successful . with that said , posting a vlog episode to your social channels , and then logging off is the equivalent to walking into a room full of people , yelling “ look ! ” and walking back out .   my main point here is that your vlog ’s engagement should never be entirely dependent on your followers initiating the conversation with their comments and messages to you . in fact , you should always be always be inviting them to engage with you , not the other way around .   therefore , make an effort to find other likeminded content creators and engage with their content , especially anyone that appears to be just starting out .   be friendly , positive , and engage with new users by leaving comments or messages that are genuine and more than just a few words . however , always avoid pandering any other users by asking directly for likes , views and follows .   when it comes to marketing yourself online , mutual support and encouragement are the keys to the relationships that you ’ll build .   so at the same time , when people do take the time to engage with you , return the favour with well - thought out responses that will make them feel like they ’re connecting with a real person , and not just a robot , who ’s only talking to them because they said hello first .   finally , whether on - camera or online , remember to always be authentic and yourself . when it comes to starting a successful vlog channel , there are only 3 things you need : keep it real , keep it fun , and let your creativity soar !   5 tips for marketing your vlog on social media   simply starting a vlog channel is not good enough . being present on social media is crucial when it comes to marketing and promoting your vlog content . however , it takes more than signing up and posting to harness the true marketing and engagement power of these online platforms .   below , we ’ll explain a few platform - specific tips for successfully marketing your brand new vlog content on social media .   facebook vlogging tips that every vlogger needs to know   when it comes launching and promoting your vlog , being present and active on facebook is an absolute must simply because it ’s singlehandedly the largest social media platform on the internet , boasting an astounding 1.79 billion daily active users .   using facebook videos is an easy , visually - appealing way to publish , engage , and share your episodes with others , especially thanks to facebook ’s auto - play feature , which enables videos to automatically begin playing when scrolled without needing clicking / tapping upon by the viewer .   although this feature can be turned off by an individual facebook user , when it ’s enabled , videos that play automatically are a great way to capture user attention , while they ’re simply scrolling by .   when uploading your vlog content to facebook , you can even take your vlog content ’s visual appeal one step further by creating custom thumbnails that can help capture potential viewer attention .   often , this small image will be the first thing your viewers see when they stumble upon your video , and in some cases , a video ’s thumbnail might be the sole decision - making factor as to whether or not a person clicks on the video to watch .   should you have a budget for it , it may also be of interest for you to create and implement a paid advertising strategy for your facebook videos and vlog content .   in fact , facebook users can “ boost ” their posts , paying per click from other users , which helps increase their visibility .   but the best part of paid advertising on facebook is that ad campaigns can integrate a huge variety of demographic targeting , such as your desired audience ’s ages , location , and interests .   keep in mind , even if you choose to host videos directly on facebook , you can also leave short links to your youtube content in the captions and comments . in turn , this allows your audience to choose which platform they want to use to follow your vlog content on .   finally , because internet users often have shorter attention spans , you might want to consider cutting out a small piece of an longer episode to create a “ trailer ” to post to your profile or page , with a brief description and link to the full video .   twitter is still a huge vlog promotion platform   twitter is an underrated platform for someone to promote a vlog channel they have recently started . one of the best things about using twitter is that it can really get you in the habit of crafting messages and content that is short , sweet , and right to the point , namely due to its 280 - tweet character limit .   depending on how many users you follow yourself , twitter can seem busy and almost overwhelming with content and conversations .   when posting vlog episodes to twitter , avoid using auto - shares from other platforms that only display the basic title and url .   not only does this tend to look a bit “ lazy ” , but it also looks robotic , and may turn off potential followers who may assume that you do n’t even take the time to log onto the network to create and curate your content .   because your tweets are going to need to be a bit shorter , try and think of a compelling intros or previews that will make users want to click through to watch your content .   for each new episode , i recommend trying to scribble down 5 to 10 different ways you can tweet about the video . then , you rotate through these options on separate days or weeks , creating multiple tweets that will all be used to promote the same piece of content .   to help make this easier , there are even platforms , such as hootsuite and buffer , which allow you to curate and schedule your content in advance . so , all you ’ll need to do is sit back and watch your tweets go live at the pre - determine date and time !   when possible , your tweets should always include something that will catch a user ’s attention . this could be an interesting quote , an intriguing statistic , or even a deep , thought - provoking question , where your video content should be the answer or solution .   you can also increase your chances of being found on twitter , by including 1 - 2 hashtags per tweet , whenever possible . but do n’t just hashtag random or common words like # video , # youtube , or # vlog .   instead , make your hashtags relatable to the content that people would actually be searching for when exploring accounts and topics that are trending .   you can even test drive your potential hashtags by searching for them and seeing what other tweets come up from other users . if you search a hashtag and a large amount of content from popular accounts show up , you can be sure that the hashtag in question is going to be good to use for your content .   finally , to create even more potential intrigue and interest in your content , you can even attach a shorter teaser video to your tweets to give users a sneak peek at what they can expect when they click on your link .   note that twitter ’s maximum video length is currently 2 minutes and 20 seconds . so for anyone who ’s videos might need a bit of a trim , make sure to check out our boosted video making tool .   do n’t ignore reddit   with reddit forums being composed of user - generated content posts , many of them have strict rules about the levels and types of self - promotion that are acceptable on the platform . you ca n’t blindly share your vlog content there .   in other words , because of the sheer number of users on the platform , including moderators , somebody will notice if you ’re blatantly posting continuously without any type of further engagement , and you ’ll risk being banned from the platform .   furthermore , the number of views on your profile also present your reddit history in a clear , easy to view list . therefore , it ’s quick and easy to conclude when a user is a shameless self - promoter or is genuinely active on the platform .   when using the platform , users can use the search box to find specific communities ( aka subreddits ) , each of which relate to the topics and interests covered in that forum .   take some time to explore the platform , reddits , and subreddits , and see what kind of posts are already taking place . this should help give you a better idea on how to best integrate yourself .   engage other users ’ discussions or inquiries and , whenever possible , try to gauge if introducing your channel , video or brand would be a natural fit among the tone , topic and comments .   respond to questions that other users might pose , and when necessary , provide them with a link to your content if they show any interest .   if your target subreddits do n’t allow link posts , consider posting your video transcript as a text post , complete with a footer that mentions how the information provided is derived from your vlog . then , you can link to it in the text .   content - rich posts are the true favourites of reddit users . therefore , as much as we ’d all love to simply drop and link or write “ i did this thing , come and see ! ” , you ’ll need to make a bit more effort if you want to succeed .   give your viewers something thought out and helpful to look at . this will help build their trust , and not only increase the possibility of them finding you off - reddit , but they ’ll also be less likely to report your posts as spam to the moderators .   similar to hashtagging on other platforms , when it comes to categorizing your reddit content , you ’ll need to use the reddit flair .   a reddit flair is a tag that can be added to your customizable username , based on moderator allowances . if your selected subreddits allow for custom flairs , make sure to add your url , which will make it visible each time you engage in a conversation .   use pinterest to cross - promote your vlog   while many people think of pinterest as just another social network , or just a photo album for pretty pictures , it ’s also a search engine , and yet another awesome opportunity for you to promote your vlog content .   to make the most of this platform , simply sign up for your free account , fill in as many profile details as possible , including your website or youtube url , and then it ’s time to start creating boards and collections of pins .   you can think of pinterest boards like cork boards you ’d see in an office space .   they ’re often categorized by theme or topic , which is exactly how you should present your episodes and other content pieces when pinning them to your profile .   whether you “ pin ” your full video or shorter preview , make sure to include a brief summary and a link in the detail box to increase searchability for other pinterest users .   a good strategy is to type some of your themes or topics into the search bar , and see what other types of similar pins users are creating . this is a great way of brainstorming how you can name and optimize future episodes .   finally , also be sure to engage this community by commenting on or re - pinning relatable content posted by other users . also , do n’t be afraid to ask questions to see what users like or how they feel about the content you ’re creating .   igtv is perfect for vloggers   made for both photo and video content , promoting your new vlog can be both simple and tricky on instagram .   unless you have the swipe - up function in instagram stories , which is only available to those with 10,000 + followers , there is only one place users can post a working url : in your main bio .   in fact , any urls pasted into your instagram captions will only show up as a basic caption text and wo n’t be clickable .   by using instagram ’s igtv feature , users are able to post short or long - form videos , which leaves it up to you how much of an episode you want your followers on this platform to see .   the maximum length of an igtv video is 60 minutes . so if your content is a lot longer , you might want to consider a condensed version or a trailer clip , followed by a call - to - action to see the full version by clicking the link in your bio .   and once again , engaging with your audience is crucial to your success on the platform .   find relevant followers , likeminded content creators , or search for relatable hashtags to find potential audience members that you think your brand could really click with , and engage with them by liking , commenting , or sharing their content to your story . this could be a game changer for your newly launched vlog channel .   10 awesome examples of successful vloggers   learning from the best is the way to do it . all of the vloggers below started their vlogs all on their own and each of them are super successful . youtube and tiktok seem to be the biggest vlogging platforms right now , so we ’ve gone ahead and highlights 10 of the best vloggers that we can all learn from .

              " '50 ways to build backlinks to your ecommerce store . we ’ve all seen this type of post before , right ? 101 ways to build backlinks . 32 white hat ways to build inbound links . by far , my favorite on is on pointblank seo at link building strategies : the complete list . plain awesome .   but …   do you know what bugs me about these posts ? none of them are tailored to multi - product ecommerce stores ! enter bootstrappers . may i present : a giant list of link building techniques , all tailored specifically to ecommerce stores using a shopping cart .   ta - da !   before we start , though , i ’m going to say this up front – these techniques are nothing new(except maybe a few that i ’ve cooked up myself and can take full credit for ) . what is new , however , is how these techniques all assume you have an ecommerce store that sells physical products and may or may not have an active content strategy .   it ’s also really important that you have diverse links . that ’s why i ’ve worked my backside off compiling this list . so you have a huge list of ideas to build on .   shall we dive in ?   1 ) guest posting   guest posting has to be the best method of building backlinks for an ecommerce store . you are in control of what pages to link to , and it ’s a great way to build deep(like product page and category page ) contextual backlinks . “ well , i knew that ! ” you might say . let ’s get into the nitty gritty .   the key to an effective guest post is getting it in front of the right audience . this is really easy when you are selling something that is research - intensive and you have written some great resources already , but what if you are selling something really simple and straightforward , like wooden block toys ? you find a community of people online that are interested in block toys and pitch your guest post there .   the best part is that your post does n’t even have to be about wooden block toys . it can be about “ safe toys for your little one , ” or “ ways to spur creativity and growth in your toddler . ” it just has to be something that will come in front of a potential buyer of yours . in the context of the article , you can build 2 - 3 tasteful links back to your site .   here ’s a tip you wo n’t hear too many places , though . when guest posting , remember to link out to other authority sites as well . this increases the value of your post in both the customer ’s eyes(it does n’t seem like a blatant marketing pitch anymore ) and in google ’s eyes , too(linking to authority sites conveys that you are genuine and not a spammer ) .   for more information on how to land guest posts , read andrew youderian ’s superb post over at shopify .   2 ) guest posting continued – relationship building   perhaps the most valuable takeaway from a guest post on an authority site is the relationship you build with the site owner . remember to reply to comments , follow up with the owner , and keep in touch . this way , one guest post can turn into an opportunity for a stream of regular guest posts , driving tons of traffic to your site and getting you a wide variety of links in the process . over the course of so many posts , you can link to so many products and categories !   3 ) research your competition   plug in your competitors website to open site explorer or majestic seo‘s link tool and see where they are getting their links from , and unabashedly start copying ! you will obviously need your own hook and content , but this will save you a lot of time that you would have spent looking for new sites . just remember to avoid going after the low authority and spammy sites . if your competitors have a lot of these , sit tight . as long as you stay clean and provide good content , it ’s only a matter of time before you outrank them .   4 ) get a link from the manufacturer   get a link from the manufacturer who ’s products you carry . often it ’s just sending them an email and asking them for a link that will do the trick . you may have to convince them you are legit , so if you have a ho - hum website with crappy content , they wo n’t buy it and will probably think you are a spammer .   5 ) article submission   article submission is the black sheep of the guest posting family . nonetheless , it ’s still a sheep , and it ’s worth getting a link from a few of these sites . now before the seos amongst you start chucking pandas and penguins my way , let me clarify : article submission does not mean articles to content farms like ezinearticles and goarticles .   what you need to do is find relevant sites that accept article submissions . here , relevance works the same way it does for guest posting . if you have a website that sells atv drivetrains , any atv / off - road / outdoor website that accepts articles is relevant .   to find websites that accept article submissions , you can try some of the following search strings :   allintitle:”keyword”+submit+article   allintitle:”keyword”+submit+guest+post   allintitle:”keyword”+articles   “ keyword ” + articles   inurl:”keyword ” + articles   inurl:”keyword ” + submit   the key difference between guest posts and article submissions is that guest posts require more effort and will generally be on higher quality / traffic websites . article websites may be “ just ok , ” but as long as they are n’t spammy and have decent pr , they will help a little . do n’t spend all your time and energy on it , though .   a final note for guest posting and articles : do n’t worry if you have the most boring product in the world . a little bit of creativity goes a long way . this guy has made a video on how to tie shoelaces so they do n’t come undone , and it ’s gotten 3000 views in just 2 months . for inspiration on how to make a boring topic interesting , check out this phenomenal article by pratik dholakya of copyblogger .   6 ) product reviews   while google frowns upon getting a followed link from a product review , when done right , and in moderation , it is n’t a bad idea . product reviews are a great way to get yourself in front of an already - existing audience while getting a valuable contextual link . just choose your targets carefully . make sure it ’s a reputable blogger – they have more at stake to lose by posting low quality content , so they always do better jobs than others .   the only caveat here is that your product needs to be your own brand and unique . if you drop - ship , there is not much incentive for a reader to buy from you than someone else – trust me here , i ’ve made this mistake – unless you have a really unique “ hook ” or selling proposition that would make it insane to buy from anyone else .   there ’s one more thing that bugs me here . most bloggers put a disclaimer on review posts stating that they received the product for free from the merchant . this could be bad , as google may just incorporate looking for that sort of text into the algorithm to devalue review links . so be careful !   7 ) interviews   this tactic is recommended by neil patel of quicksprout . it ’s an awesome way to build links(or at least get tweets or shares ) for your ecommerce site . just find an influencer in your niche and interview them . people can never get enough publicity , so a little bit of flattery goes a long , long way !   to find influencers , look on social media sites like twitter and facebook . again , the influencer does n’t have to be directly involved in your niche . if you sell wedding linens , you could talk to a wedding planner blogger who has a large following . the key is to think creatively and be persistent . do n’t expect to email one person and get a response .   email one hundred , and get ten responses . that ’s how internet marketing works . a quick tip from neil : if this influencer has a press page , he says that there is a 95 % chance they will link to the interview .   8) link pages – “ the request , stranger edition ”   “ the request ” is as simple as finding websites that link out to sites in your niche and sending them a quick email asking for a link back to your site . success rates will vary , depending on the kind of business you have and the kind of site they run .   for example , i used to have an ecommerce store where i sold reusable sandwich bags(yup , that ’s a thing ! ) . my store was very closely tied to a message : “ recycle , protect the earth – be green . ” it was comparatively easier for me to get links just on request because people in that niche are really passionate about going green and love to spread the word .   for a different type of site , say , one that sells wall decals , your success rate with asking home decor sites to link to you may be a little lower .   remember , your outreach efforts will be a lot more successful if you develop a little rapport with the site owner first – see andrew ’s guest blogging post i referenced above .   9 ) link pages – “ the request , friends & family edition ”   this one is pretty straightforward . ask you friends and family to link to you , tweet about you , share stuff on facebook , myspace , instagram , vine , youtube , and in any other way they are active on the web .   10 ) link pages “ the broken link ”   credit goes to brian dean of backlinko.com for this one . helping a webmaster out with a broken link is a great way to get your proverbial foot in the door . using check my links , a handy and free chrome extension(find it in the toolkit ) , you can get see which links are broken . next step ? email the webmaster informing them of the broken links , and casually ask for a link back to your site .   if the website does n’t have a contact page or social profiles , you can search the domain name on whois and if the domain info is public , you can find the site owner ’s email address . send them an email , and see what happens . success rates will vary from niche to niche , but expect one or two replies for every fifty to one hundred messages you send(yes , it ’s that much work ! )   11 ) link pages – “ the sucky website ”   this technique requires a)technical / creative know - how or b)some cash . basically , you find a website that has good pagerank but the design is horrible . like vomit - inducing horrible . next , you send your pitch to the website owner , saying you are in the same niche with an ecommerce store , have experience with web design , and offer to redo their website(or at least a part of it ) for free . if they really want to thank you , they can link to you !   if they say yes(preferably to both the design and the link ! ) , head on over to fiverr to find a guy or gal to outsource the design to . getting logos , headers , or basic framework of a website designed should n’t be more than $ 20 - 25 . for that much , you ’ve earned yourself a link on a high - pr website ! just remember to be specific with your design offer to the webmaster – “ i can redo your logo ” or “ i can redo your header ” is good , but “ i ’ll overhaul your website ” will require a really fat wallet .   12 ) infographics   infographics are gold mines for getting backlinks , and are the new big thing . which like every other big thing has become saturated and commonplace with everyone throwing up infographics for the hell of it . not good , you think ? i say , great ! the more low quality content there is out there , the higher potential there is to shine by outdoing everyone else in the field . collect some data related to your niche , display it in a compelling and entertaining way , and start promoting ! a good place to start is visual.ly – next up , approach bloggers and influencers and ask them to share / tweet it . it ’s a lot of work , but it pays off .   13 ) brand ambassadors – bloggers   if you are selling a message with your products(and you definitely should be ) , you can get like - minded bloggers and internet personalities to push your message(and along with it , your product ) . reuseit.com , a retailer that sells eco friendly products does a phenomenal job of this . this is a difficult thing to achieve , but once you have it down , you will have a whole army of brand evangelists(that are linking back to your website ) .   14 ) brand ambassadors – customers   while this may not always earn you a “ link ” it will certainly earn you some buzz on social media , which is just as important . nothing is more important for your brand than a happy customer raving about you and the awesome service they received from you , because nothing influences a buyer more than their friend recommending something .   15 ) directories – dmoz   dmoz is a love - hate directory . while being one of the most authoritative directory links you can get on the web , it ’s ridiculously difficult to get into . processing usually takes months , and even then , there is no guarantee you will get in . still , it ’s worth a shot . getting a link from here will flow some nice link juice back to your site .   tip : if it ’s taking forever to get listed , consider becoming an editor ( ! )   16 ) directories – botw   best of the web is a really authoritative directory , but at a cost . for $ 150.00 , you can get a link from a high - pr and highly trusted website . when you think about it as a bootstrapper , though , you would think twice before shelling out that sort of cash for a link . you need to be the judge here – if your potential clients refer to directories like botw a lot(and this may be true for b2b niches ) , it may be worth getting the link . otherwise , you may not see a return on your $ 150 .   17 ) directories – family friendly sites   another authoritative directory , familyfriendlysites.com will pass high pr to your site . it costs less than botw , at $ 49 for the submission , so it may be worth checking out . the one caveat is you have to be selling kid - friendly stuff , otherwise you wo n’t get listed !   18 ) directories – niche specific   these are not too difficult to find online , and worth getting links from if they are reputable . use the “ grandma test ” to judge reputable or not – would you be comfortable with your grandma visiting this site ? if so , awesome ! their link submission processes are pretty straightforward and you get a relevant link that can send you some nice traffic .   find niche directories with the following search phrases :   “ keyword”+directories   “ keyword”+directory   keyword+directory(searching without the quotes will give you a broader match . if you search archery without quotes , you might get results for “ bow and arrow ” too .   19 ) icon sites   credit again to brain dean for this one(the man is a backlinking genius ) . there are many graphics sites where you can submit icon sets , like social media icons to . make icons themed to your niche and submit them there . find a list of them here .   20 ) web 2.0 – squidoo   seos have a love - hate relationship with squidoo , but honestly , it does n’t hurt to have one or two lenses with links pointing back to your site , especially if your potential customers are active on it ! a quick search using some of your keywords will show you what people have made lenses about . there will be lots of junky ones too , so make sure that there are a few that look genuine and have signs of participation on them . just make sure to link out to other authority sites(and lenses ) too so it does n’t look like your lens is solely for a link – they are no - followed , anyway .   21 ) web 2.0 – blogger and wordpress   sites like blogger.com and wordpress.org are nice free ways to make web 2.0 blogs that you can publish content on and link it back to your site . a word of advice : make a separate account using a different name , otherwise it seems a little dodgy that you are pushing your own content . make sure that you link to authority pages as well as your own , and use services like scoop.it and reddit to drive some quick traffic to it . write quality content , though . something that people would n’t mind sharing !   22 ) .edu – employee discounts   .edu links are considered the “ holy grail of links ” amongst some seos . i do n’t know how true that is , but .edu domains are trusted and have tons of authority . a lot of universities have employee discount programs that you can sign up as a retailer to offer . pretty easy links to get , if you ask me ! some(most ) universities will require that you have a physical address and a phone number .   23 ) .edu – sponsoring clubs   if you have a hobby - related niche , you can approach universities that have clubs in your niche . so if you sold say pogo sticks , you could search for “ xx college pogo stick club , ” and offer to be one of their sponsors . this would involve either a)giving a cash contribution or b)giving a product contribution . both are a little expensive to do , but they will get you a .edu link .   24 ) .edu – resource pages   many sites hosted on .edu domains have link pages where they link out to relevant and informative websites . if you have a relevant and informative resource on your ecommerce site , you can email those website owners informing them of your resource and ask them to link to you . this is the .edu version of “ the request . ”   25 ) contests & giveaways   maybe not the best option if you sell expensive things like 24 karat gold cufflinks , but if you sell something within a $ 100-$150 price range , a contest is something worth looking into . with a contest , you approach a blog(or blogs ) , and ask them to sponsor the contest for you . usually they will require you to buy ad space or send them a product sample . they review the product and host the contest on their blog , and the way people can enter is that they have to like / follow you for an entry . if your host blog is big , the contest will be picked up by other smaller blogs that will link to that blog and maybe your site as well . for one or two samples of your product , you end up getting a few hundred likes / followers and a nice link or two .   it ’s really important to cultivate and engage these likes and followers right away , otherwise you will effectively lose them , because your posts just wo n’t show up in their feeds anymore !   26 ) pinterest profiles   did you know that the main link on your pinterest profile to your website is a followed link ? so are the links to your profile from the profiles of people you follow , so the more people you follow and vice versa , the more link juice flows to your profile and from your profile to your website – some popular pinterest boards have pageranks of 3 and 4 .   27 ) reddit   i used to think that reddit ’s links were not indexed , but apparently , i was wrong . i was going through the backlink profile of an online store(that i pulled from open site explorer ) and one of their links was from an ama that the owner had done on reddit . pretty cool , if you ask me . if your post gets enough upvotes and a lot of comments , search engines will index it . which is just plain awesome , because reddit is an insanely authoritative domain . it ’s actually “ crowdsourced winnowing ! ” . just do n’t spam them , otherwise you will get blocked , or worse …   28 ) fiverr   fiverr is full of shitty seo gigs like i will build 10,000 links to your site and stuff like that . the sad part is those gigs get good reviews , too ! ignore those – they will destroy your store and make you pay for it(with $ 5 ) . however , you can find loads of enterprising bloggers that offer to put up a guest post on their blog for just $ 5 . as long as you find a relevant blog , or somehow make the blog relevant(by drawing a connection that makes sense ) , you ’re good to go . but please , please ignore the link building gigs . if it were that easy , everyone would be ranking .   29 ) google +   building a good google plus profile that you share content from regularly is a great investment for drawing traffic and potentially increasing your rankings . while google has been very mysterious about how much +1s influence rankings , it ’s still worthwhile to be active on g+ . an awesome plus point is that links that you share are followed !   30 ) haro   help a reporter out is a service that connects publishers to anyone that wants to give an opinion in the news and press . signing up is free , and every day you will get 3 emails with queries from reporters . if you find a query that is related to your niche and you have a worthy opinion to offer , send them an email . if they reply and decide to quote you , you get a nice strong press backlink as well as a flood of traffic from that article . win - win ! the only issue is that you are n’t going to get too many related queries . as of this writing , i ’ve been a member for 4 months and have seen maybe two or three relevant queries . still , it takes 30 seconds to skim their email , so still completely worth it .   31 ) press releases   even though google is downplaying press releases , it ’s still a good way to get exposure for your brand . i ’m emphasizing exposure here , and only including this idea in this list because you do get a backlink out of it . however , the sole purpose of doing a press release is not to get a link , so if you do n’t have something newsworthy to say , save yourself the $ 100 that companies like prweb(effective ) charge until you do have something good to say .   it ’s also a good idea not to use keywords in your press releases to save yourself from an anchor text penalty from google , just in case scrapers pick up your news release and decide to spam the web .   32 ) buying guides & how - to guides   if you can write an ultimate guide or definitive guide to your niche ’s products and put it up on your website , you have created some really awesome linkbait . then you just need to get word out to the right people , and hopefully , with a few shares , likes , tweets , and links , you have a nice , link - juice - rich page that distributes all that love to the rest of your site .   33 ) roundups   i saw this idea on a whiteboard friday from moz . do a roundup of anything related to influencers in your niche . you can either round up their posts , or do a round up of their opinions(which you would have to ask them for first ) , then send them an email informing them that you ’ve written so and so about them . they will almost certainly tweet / share it , and if you are lucky , you will get a nice backlink out of it , too .   34 ) buy blogs   an expensive option , but a great way to get hundreds ( thousands even ) of links to your ecommerce site . find blogs in your niche and just offer to buy them . you will have a heckuva lot more content to manage , but hey , you are getting links , right ? just make sure not to host them on your own account otherwise it ’s just a matter of time before google gets wind that all these blogs are hosted suspiciously close to each other …   35 ) buy expired domains   expired domains in your niche that have links pointing to them(a quick search in open site explorer will tell you ) are great sources of link juice . buy the domain and redirect it using a 301 redirect to your site , and watch the link juice flow .   36 ) have a unique shopping experience   if you can reinvent the proverbial wheel for the way people shop in your niche , expect a giant deluge of links to head your way . i ca n’t tell you how many links zappos.com has earned this way(look , they got one here , too ) . by offering free shipping both ways – since shoes are something that might not always fit – they rewrote the online shopping rules and not only got raving customers , but got thousands of links from all corners of the web , too .   37 ) have a unique product   a unique product is as good as a unique shopping experience , provided your product is something people need and want ! or it ’s just something so incredibly cool that it deserves a mention anyway . my favorite example of this is remee , which is a sleep - mask that is designed to help you have lucid dreams that you can control . how awesome is that ?   38 ) similar businesses   i ’ve done this for one of my earlier ecommerce businesses . basically , you find businesses that are similar to yours , but do n’t overlap , and request them to link to you . obviously no one is going to do that for free , so you need to get on their good side first . promote their products on your social media accounts , mention them on your blogs and web 2.0 properties , and let them know you think they are awesome and that you promote their stuff . with a little bit of perseverence , they will link out to you , or at least promote you to their followers . you can even consider offering their customers a special discount code when they shop with you .   39 ) yahoo answers   google seems to love yahoo answers when people search using question keywords . keep an eye out on yahoo answers and answer questions relevant to your niche . when you provide valuable answers and quote your website as a source , it becomes a backlink to your site . they are nofollowed , but if your answer is insightful and valuable , anyone who sees it in the future will click through to your site . win !   40 ) quora   pretty much the same as yahoo answers , quora is a nice place to answer targeted queries from potential buyers . the link juice may not be too much(or none at all if the link is nofollowed ) , but it ’s a great way to potentially drive traffic .   41 ) rss feeds   feedburner is a great place to submit your rss feeds , whether they are product feeds or news feeds . they have insane domain authority and can send you potential traffic , too . other feed aggregating websites are also musts for submitting product feeds , and they add a nice backlink to your link profile . bigcommerce has the option for product feeds and news feeds . i ’m sure there is a magento plugin out there somewhere too that creates an rss feed from your products .   42 ) affiliate programs   this one is a little risky , because people often spam the web with spun content and poor affiliate links . as long as you choose your affiliates wisely , you can ask for a natural link along with normal affiliate links . you can find affiliate software at commission junction , share a sale , or idevaffiliate .   43 ) be cheeky !   write cheeky content and share / promote it on the web to earn some nice social media action and links . luckily , with cheeky , there ’s a whole lot of stuff you can pull off . try mythbusting , exploring an unpopular opinion(be careful not to insult anyone ! ) , or just being the badass of your niche . for badassery in online marketing , check out ittybiz – they have an edgy style that ends up being a massive link magnet .   this description from method home is another great example of having flair(and inviting links – this store was featured on shopify ’s blog )   44 ) slideshare   while slideshare is much more powerful in ranking for a difficult keyword than it is in getting a link , you will still get a nice backlink from your user profile . if your slideshow becomes really popular and gets lots of shares / likes / links , your profile and website will get a share of that link juice , too ! slideshare is a great way of remarketing your existing content . change the keywords around a little bit , and make a nice slideshow using powerpoint . you need to do a little promotion for your slideshow , too , of course . interacting with other slideshare users is a good place to start .   45 ) scribd   scribd.com is a document sharing website that works similarly to slideshare . you get a nice backlink from your profile page . you need to interact and be active , though , otherwise your profile page may never be indexed .   46 ) testimonials for other businesses   credit to andrew youderian for this one . if there is a business or service you use and love(preferably for your own business ) , write them a testimonial to post on their blog . most businesses will jump at the opportunity and publish your testimonial along with a nice fat link to your website . awesome , right ?   47 ) blog commenting   blog commenting links are usually nofollowed ( except for a few rare ones ) , but they are still good ways to drive traffic and get noticed by search engines . spencer haws from nichepursuits uses blog comments as an integral part of ranking his niche sites . remember that comments have to be value - adding and insightful , so “ thank you boss your post is very much informative for widget lovers everywhere ” is not going to cut it .   48 ) social bookmarking   although not as effective now as it was in it ’s heyday , social bookmarking is still a potential source of traffic and a good link if your content is that good and enough people share it .   49 ) 800 directories   so this one is an idea i found in the advanced guide to link building by neil patel and brian dean . there are certain directories on the web that list all the 800 , 888 , 877 , 866 , 855(and so on ) numbers of online businesses . the best part ? the links are followed ! the only caveat is you need an 800 number(d - oh ! ) . you can get one for as little as 10 $ to start out with at 800.com .   50 ) wikipedia source   this is a nofollowed link , but still a great way to get some traffic . if and only if your site has a resources page or a few really good articles , you can sneak it in as a citation on the wikipedia page for it . if there is n’t a wikipedia page for your product , make one !   woah . my fingertips are sore and i think i ’m seeing small depressions in my keyboard . but there you have it : 50 actionable ways you can use right now to start building links to your ecommerce website . do each and every one of those twice , and you will have 100 unique linking domains pointing to you . a feat that will make you an seo force to be reckoned with .',\n",

              " 'is using breadcrumb schema no longer necessary ? . earlier today , i noticed that google was testing out displaying breadcrumbs for all sites that had a visible url is search results .   i first noticed is when opening an incognito window , where i was able to capture the screenshot comparison above .   i ’m now seeing this everywhere on desktop , which makes me think this has now been rolled out for everyone .   this is an interesting one , because sites that are not using breadcrumblist schema and receiving a similar serp treatment to those that are .   google is guessing the pathway based on the url structure , which is an easy one to figure out for well - structured sites .   using the schema was a great way to standout in serps , and was something that would be an important item in my audits .   this is because you were able to provide more structure to your url appearance in attempt to increase clicks through to your site .   here i made note of youtube results being pushed into a carousel , because their urls are quite messy . harder for google to automatically structure those :   more examples . note how g filtered out those yt videos from the test . clearly too scared to try decipher those urls . they put them in a video carousel instead , where the url is n’t visible . pic.twitter.com/fh0enmlqkx — brodie clark ( @brodieseo ) august 22 , 2019   the difference between using schema for serp appearance and this rollout is the control you have over the words used in the navigation , along with not having hyphens included with lowercase words .   final thoughts   this is another one of those things in seo which puts everyone on a similar playing field , like we saw with meta descriptions becoming dynamic .   i suspect google has launched this one because most sites are not implementing the schema correctly , resulting in a bad experience for users .   there is however still room for improvement from what i can see from the automatically generated breadcrumbs , so there ’s still some benefit ( from a ctr perspective ) .   adding breadcrumbs to your site through schema is generally a pretty easy one to implement too , so there is n’t much of an argument to not longer have them added dynamically to your pages .   the good news is that , for whatever reason , your site was not using breadcrumbs and has a tidy url structure – then this could be a positive thing for you .   as always , let me know if you ’re seeing this test too and your thoughts on the change .   postscript : do n’t like the breadcrumbs showing for all urls ? use this great extension developed by detailed .',\n",
              " 'google ’s web stories now prominently featured on mobile in the us . key sections : what it is – how to rank – tracking – final thoughts   the time has come . google is now prominently displaying the ‘ visual stories ’ unit ( that features web stories ) on mobile in the us . this is after an intense period of testing that begun late last year .   visual stories have the ability to take up a lot of space on mobile , and should be a feature for seo professionals to pay attention to . especially when triggered for high value queries .   in my post , i ’ll be providing a rundown of some important information that you should be aware of when trying to rank within the visual stories unit on google . such as where the unit appears , the types of arrangements that can show , tips for getting featured , and more .   before i get stuck into my post , make sure to check out my latest web story about the top seo tools on google . this is web story that i ’ll be using as an example throughout my post , and was pretty happy with how it came together from a design / development / strategy standpoint .   what is the visual stories feature on google ?   visual stories is a module that appears in google ’s search results on mobile . the feature includes a collection of web stories that google algorithmically selects to show for users .   the feature will only ever appear on the first page of google , with placement either being toward the top , middle or bottom of search results on mobile . if the feature does n’t appear on pg.1 , that means that it has n’t been triggered .   based on the current us rollout , there is 3 treatments that can appear for web stories within the unit . the treatments range between showing either 2 , 3 or 4 web stories at once . when 3 appear in the unit , the top ranking web story becomes larger than the rest .   google ’s visual stories unit can show in various different displays , ranging from 2 web stories to 4 web stories .   if there are 4 web stories in a unit ( the full treatment ) , it appears that a single site can take up to 2 spots in the grid of 4 . i ’ve not seen more than 2 at this point , but i ’ve seen the same site appear twice on several occasions . so if you ’re already ranking in the unit , there ’s an opportunity to appear again .   at the moment , the feature is still only available in the us for all users . i have however seen significant amounts of testing in countries such as india and canada , so i would expect to see this rollout extended in the near future .   now that you have an understanding of the visual stories unit as a serp feature on google , let ’s discuss some important factors when trying to rank within the unit on mobile .   how to rank within visual stories ?   there are some important considerations when trying to rank web stories in general on google . i discussed many of these considerations in a post from august 2020 related to web stories seo tips , which still remains true to this day .   in my post , i discussed specific seo tips to get your web stories ranking on google . the same applies to the visual stories unit , which employs many of the same ranking signals as web search .   in particular , here are some important tips to keep in mind :   quality control : like any other web page , maintaining quality content is crucial to ranking , and even getting indexed in the first place . if your web story is 3 slides long and does n’t add any value to readers , you may find that your web story may not rank or become indexed on google .   : like any other web page , maintaining quality content is crucial to ranking , and even getting indexed in the first place . if your web story is 3 slides long and does n’t add any value to readers , you may find that your web story may not rank or become indexed on google . effective html usage : again just like a web page , if there is n’t text for google to crawl , then it ’s unlikely that google will be able to develop a thorough understanding of your web story content . ensure text is n’t burnt into images and using html elements correctly .   : again just like a web page , if there is n’t text for google to crawl , then it ’s unlikely that google will be able to develop a thorough understanding of your web story content . ensure text is n’t burnt into images and using html elements correctly . killer design : this is one of the most difficult to nail with web stories . adding colour and visuals on the fly will rarely cut it when it comes to web stories . you should instead be using storyboarding and have a designer on hand to assist with getting visuals right . because of the visual nature of web stories , if you do n’t nail your design , then the web story could easily fall flat .   this is one of the most difficult to nail with web stories . adding colour and visuals on the fly will rarely cut it when it comes to web stories . you should instead be

crucial for placement in the visual stories unit . if missing , i would n’t expect to appear for your target query .   : this should be an obvious one when it comes to seo . adding the target query and variations in a natural way to the h1 , title tag , and throughout the content is crucial for placement in the visual stories unit . if missing , i would n’t expect to appear for your target query . survey the serp : you may notice that the visual stories unit does n’t appear for all queries . this is because there either is n’t enough relevant content for google to present ( less than 2 relevant web stories ) , or that google does n’t think the query is relevant for that type of content format . complete your own testing before creation to ensure the unit appears . for instance , i was confident that the query “ seo ” and “ seo tools ” were triggering the unit prior to creation , so i made sure to include those queries in the correct locations .   the above should make a good foundation when creating your web stories to have the ability to rank within the visual stories unit . but the truth is , web story creation is quite difficult . i ’ve created 3 web stories so far , which have progressively becomes better over time . but it took time to master the creation process .   now that you have a good understanding of the basics when it comes to web stories and the visual stories unit , let ’s discuss how you can track the progress of your web story getting included in the top ranking visual stories results .   tracking inclusion in the visual stories unit   when it comes to tracking your visual stories performance , the best way of doing this is via 1st party data through your own verified google search console account .   at the moment , there is n’t a filter in the search appearance report within gsc to see visual stories inclusions , but there is a filter for ‘ web story ’ which can be a helpful starting point .   the visual stories unit has a very low ctr currently . this may change as the push becomes stronger and users become more aware of the format , but i would n’t expect a ton of clicks from inclusion in the visual stories unit at this point .   because visual stories can appear for very broad queries like “ seo ” , you ’re bound to get a very sudden spike in impressions to alert you of the change . here ’s what this can look like :   a spike in impressions in google search console from a web story url appearing in google ’s visual stories unit .     from this point , you ’ll need to become a detective with your search query data for the web story url in question . there are several clues you can look to when trying to figure out the source , relating to the country , device and average position metrics .   although gsc query data is sampled , you ’ll still be able to get a good idea of where the visibility is coming from when drilling into the queries with the most impressions . here ’s what the query data looks like for the graph above :   queries that have triggered the web story unit to receive impressions on google .   to be sure that the visual stories unit is appearing , the only way you can confirm is by looking at google ’s mobile search results for the query . the above data includes visibility in various countries that had visual stories appearing during the testing phase , but it ’s only the us that has the rollout currently .   it is also important to note that the visual stories unit counts as a single position within google search console . so if your web story appears in the top position within the unit ( like my web story does ) or in the 4th position in the sequence , that will still count as a single spot .   at the time of writing this post , there are no seo tool providers that have the ability to track appearance within the visual stories unit . i pinged semrush earlier this year to give them the heads - up that the launch was coming , but did n’t hear back . so it ’s now open to whichever tool provider wants to get the credit for the first to add to their dashboard .   final thoughts   the rollout of the visual stories unit in the us on mobile is certainly one for seos to pay attention to . because it ’s now available to all users , we ’ll likely see far more eye balls on web stories that are included .   a major downside to the feature that i ’m seeing so far , and have seen confirmed by others in the past , is the exceedingly low ctr that you currently receive from placement in the unit . a big part of this was because of the testing phase , where i had web stories ranking for the query “ google ” ( very irrelevant query ) , but the ctr is even low for the query “ seo tools ” which should be bang on with intent .   for this reason , i ’m not yet confident enough to be able to recommend the web story format to clients of mine as a viable publishing format . when the clicks start to come , that conversation could change . but now that i ’m also seeing a lot less discover visibility for web stories ( anecdotally ) , am wondering about what the true benefits actually are .   what i would say though : if you have the visual stories unit showing for a high value query , and most of the web stories that are ranking within the unit are poorly created , go for it . those impressions are worth something , even if the web story is n’t actually viewed . especially if you have your brand logo prominently in google ’s search results for an otherwise impossibly hard to rank for query .',\n",
              " 'how to use hashtags : how many , best ones , and where to use them . this post originally published on april 8 , 2014 . we ’ve updated it here with new info , screenshots , and a special episode of the buffer podcast – the science of social media .   have you ever found yourself explaining how to use hashtags to someone whose only connection with the word is as a telephone button ?   internet language has evolved considerably over the past few years as social media has taken off . hashtags are a huge part of this evolution . what once was a telephone button is now a social media phenomenon . no wonder people are curious .   when they ask , i tell them that hashtags are a pound sign immediately followed by a keyword . they ’re used for categorization on social media . yes , they can be annoying if overused . and yes , i ’ve seen the hashtag video of jimmy fallon and justin timberlake .   hashtags also have the potential to be truly valuable . the stats and info below make a pretty clear case that we should be understanding , using , and appreciating hashtags .     interested in listening to this post in the podcast format ? we invite you to check out an episode on this topic in buffer ’s very own podcast – the science of social media !   how to listen : itunes | google play | soundcloud | stitcher | rss   if you ’re looking for a completely cut - and - dry ruling on the topic of hashtags , then here it is : you should be using hashtags .   the proliferation of hashtags is truly incredible . what began on twitter has now spread to facebook , google+ , instagram , google search , and almost everywhere in between . ( linkedin   before giving up . )   the widespread acceptance of hashtags should give you plenty of reason to consider using them . i also really enjoy the case laid out by steve cooper , writing for forbes.com :   as ridiculous as hashtags might seem to marketing veterans who remember a time before twitter and facebook , the younger generation and potential customers / clients do n’t . to them , using hashtags is as natural and common as typing their query into the search box .   not only could people be typing in your hashtag on a google search , but they could very well be doing it in twitter , too . in this sense , a hashtag will make your content viewable by anyone with an interest in your hashtag , regardless of whether they ’re part of your clan or not .   a hashtag immediately expands the reach of your tweet beyond just those who follow you , to reach anyone interested in that hashtag phrase or keyword .   but how to use hashtags is a different story completely . how do you find the best ones for your content and make sure you ’ve got them in the right number , on the right social network ? let ’s break it down .   tweets with hashtags get two times more engagement than tweets without .   this data , courtesy of buddy media , is one of the most - cited examples of the effectiveness of hashtags , and for good reason : doubling your online engagement is a big deal ! imagine going from four retweets to eight or 10 retweets to 20 . and all it takes is a simple # or two ?   apparently so . although , you ’ll want to keep it to no more than two .   buddy media ’s research also showed that   : one or two hashtags appear to be the max . when you use more than two hashtags , your engagement actually drops by an average of 17 percent .   twitter ’s own research into hashtags confirms that there is significant advantage to using them . individuals can see a 100 percent increase in engagement by using hashtags ( the same bump as seen in the buddy media study ) . brands can see a 50 percent increase .   engagement , as measured in these studies , can include clicks , retweets , favorites , and replies , yet if it ’s only retweets your after , hashtags still would be a smart bet .   tweets with one or more hashtag are 55 percent more likely to be retweeted .   dan zarella discovered this effect in a study on retweeting behavior that included more than 1.2 million tweets . the large scope of the study made for a 99.9 percent confidence interval with the results .   the one caveat to hashtags on twitter might come for those brands looking to gain clicks on twitter ads . in the case of advertisements , twitter found that tweets without a # or @-mention generate 23 percent more clicks .   the reason ? hashtags and @-mentions give people more places to click inside a tweet instead of focusing solely on a call - to - action .   instagram is another hotspot for hashtags , and the good news for those who love to extensively tag photos is that there does n’t seem to be a saturation point .   interactions are highest on instagram posts with 11 + hashtags .   a rule of thumb could be : do n’t sweat your amount of instagram hashtags .   the best part about this recommendation is that the data comes from a set of users with 1,000 or fewer followers — a group that likely includes small businesses and those just diving in to instagram . in other words , hashtags could be your best bet for growing a fast following on instagram .   the instagram shadowban   there has been a lot of talk recently among marketers about what ’s called the instagram shadowban . essentially , a shadowban is when instagram withholds the distribution of your photo or video on instagram due to “ inappropriate content . ” inappropriate content can vary widely , but usually it has to do with the content of the photos or videos themselves or spam - like behavior such as using bots to engage with users or banned hashtags .   later put together an interesting and insightful guide on how to navigate the instagram shadowban in order to keep your account in the green and your photos / videos seen . in that article , later shares a direct statement from the instagram team regarding the proper use of hashtags on the platform :   how to avoid shadowbanning on instagram   alex tooby , instagram expert and influencer , shares her top tips on how to avoid the instagram shadowban . here ’s a quick overview so that you can keep your account in the clear today :   avoid using banned or broken hashtags in your caption and/or comments   avoid using any type of software that violates instagram ’s terms of service   avoid any big surges in your instagram activity ( ex . , liking or commenting with bots )   avoid being reported by users by posting only appropriate content to instagram   looking to learn more about the instagram shadowban ? we cover that and more in this episode of our buffer podcast – the science of social media !   how to listen : itunes | google play | soundcloud | stitcher | rss   so yes , twitter and instagram are clear winners for hashtags . but what about facebook ? here ’s where the recommendation gets a little trickier .   facebook posts without a hashtag fare better than those with a hashtag .   hashtags have only been around on facebook since june 2013 , and three months later , research from edgerank checker found that using hashtags on facebook has zero positive effect on reach . posts without hashtags outperform those with hashtags .   a lot could have changed since september , when this data was first released . should you abandon hashtags on facebook solely due to this research ? it ’s probably best to test . there ’s still a lot of analysis left to be done . for instance , social bakers studied posts in february of this year and found that using hashtags might not be the main worry , but rather using too many hashtags ( just like the advice on twitter ) .   on google+ , your posts are given hashtags automatically based on their content , but you can also edit them or add your own . also unique about google+ : you can add hashtags in your comments as well as your post – double the opportunities to be found .   and since google+ is google ’s social network , hashtags are now built right into google searches . if you type in a hashtag search , you ’ll get the normal search results plus a sidebar of relevant google+ posts . hashtags have truly arrived !   google+ ’s “ related hashtags ” also offer smart marketers a brainstorming opportunity to discover new content ideas and gauge interest level in specific topics .     using the right tools , you can use hashtags as an organization system for your social media campaigns . with everything collected under one hashtag banner , you can see at - a - glance the reach of your campaign and the discussions happening around the topic .   1 . hashtagify.me   one of the most complete hashtag tools you will find , hashtagify.me has reams of data you can use to analyze hashtags . the most helpful could very well be the first data you ’re shown : related hashtags and their popularity . when you type in a hashtag , the service will show you other hashtags to consider and will display visually how popular each hashtag is and how closely it correlates to the original .   2 . ritetag   ritetag helps ensure that the tags you use are well - chosen by showing you how good , great , or overused a particular hashtag is . the visual organization of hashtags into colored bars works great for quick analysis at - a - glance .   3 .   with tagboard , you can see how your hashtag is used across multiple networks . the results pages on tagboard show hashtagged posts from twitter , facebook , instagram , google+ , vine , and app.net   4 . twitalyzer   though not an explicitly hashtag tool , twitalyzer does show hashtags as part of its audit of twitter accounts . input the username of someone you want to investigate , and twitalyzer can tell you what hashtags he or she uses most often . this can be really helpful in finding out how your niche ’s influencers tweet .   local businesses might find value in trendsmap , which shows you relevant hashtags that are being used in your geographic area . ( # wrestlemania is a popular one where i am in idaho . )   4 steps to find the right hashtag to use   using the tools above , you can hone in on a few ideal hashtags to start with , and like most things online , test and iterate from there .   1 . learn from the best : what hashtags are influencers using ?   twitalyzer can give you a good foundation of where to begin for your hashtag search by showing you how influencers are using hashtags . grab a handful of usernames of people and brands in your industry whom you admire , and input the accounts into twitalyzer . at the bottom of the results page , you ’ll see a section for their most commonly - used hashtags . add the relevant ones to your list of potential hashtags .   let ’s say i wanted to find some hashtags to use in promoting social media marketing content . i might start with a list of names like jeff bullas , jay baer , mari smith , and ann handley . here is what the hashtag results on twitalyzer look like for jeff bullas :   info like this would lead me to start a short list of hashtags like :   # socialmedia   # smm   # twitter   # contentmarketing   # social   # content   # marketing   2 . cover all your bases : are there related hashtags you should be considering ?   armed with an idea list of hashtags , you can then hop into hashtagify.me to see which related hashtags might also be worth pursuing . while you ’re doing this exercise , take note of the circle size on your results : the larger the circle , the more popular the hashtag .   again , following our social media marketing example , here is what the results page would look like for a search of # socialmedia :   not every hashtag listed here will be relevant to you , but it does help to see some that you might not have previously considered . in the case of our example , i might add # business , # infographic , and hashtags of specific network names like # twitter and # facebook .   3 . identify the all - stars : which hashtags are the best to use ?   popularity and volume can be good indicators of the value of your hashtag , but you may wish to go one step further . hashtagify.me has advanced , premium tools that let you go deeper into statistics on individual hashtags . in a pinch , you can also get some solid data from ritetag and their visual expression of   how much each tag can boost your post ’s reach .   among posts that contain the word “ marketing , ” ritetag shows these tags as the most likely to be great , good , or overused . ( there ’s that # wrestlemania tag again ! )   4 . double check : could your chosen hashtags mean something else entirely ?   one last check before you finalize your list of hashtags should be whether or not the hashtag you ’ve chosen is being used elsewhere in an entirely different context .   the worst thing that can happen when using a hashtag is to realize after it ’s tweeted that the same hashtag is used for an entirely different topic .   jawbone tried a # knowyourself campaign on instagram , only to find that the hashtag was already being used generically by thousands of users in all sorts of different contexts . this did n’t necessarily ruin jawbone ’s campaign , but it may have made life a little more difficult for the marketing team .   takeaways   hopefully you ’ve learned the value of hashtags here and a few neat ideas on how to find some to use in your social sharing . if you ’re looking for a simple rule of thumb for hashtagging posts , i think there ’s a lot of truth here in this advice from the next web :   rule of thumb : 1 – 3 tags is best over all platforms .   twitter : to categorize   pinterest : to brand , and be specific ( tags are only clickable in pin descriptions )   instagram : to build community , and be unique / detailed   google+ : to categorize ; autogenerates tags based on what it thinks your post is most relevant to   tumblr : to categorize interests , can be specific and general ( has a “ track your tags ” feature )   facebook : sort of a hashtag fail – if your audience is very business - minded , follow twitter rules ; if it is community - oriented , follow pinterest / instagram rules   what hashtags do you routinely use on social media ? i ’d love to hear how you ’ve put hashtags to work in your social media strategy .   p.s. if you liked this post , you might enjoy our buffer blog newsletter . receive each new post delivered right to your inbox , plus our can’t - miss weekly email of the internet ’s best reads . sign up here .   image credit : mikecogh , unsplash , iconfinder , pablo , quick sprout',\n",
              " 'buffer retreat : why we spent $ 111,874 meeting face to face . travel is embedded pretty deeply into buffer ’s values — so much so that our entire remote team meets up every 5 months at various spots around the world .   our buffer retreats are special times for our remote , distributed team to connect in person with one another , with our buffer audience and with the community of our host city .   traveling to different locations each time also gives us a great new perspective on gratitude and the extreme privilege we have to be able to work and live the way we do .   we ’ve talked before on the blog about the reasons why we go on retreats , but for this post i thought it might be fun to get more into the details of what we do during our retreats — how we work , what activities we get up to , and , in the spirit of transparency we ’re so fond of here , what it all costs . ( i ’ve converted everything into u.s. dollars for ease of reading . )   in case your company might be considering its own get - together , i hope this post might answer some frequently asked questions about retreats .     where to go ?   the first big question : where should we go ? this one is really fun to answer every 5 months . so far , the team has been to :   lake tahoe   thailand   south africa   new york   sydney   one thing that ’s really neat about being a workplace with no managers is that retreats , too , happen organically . no one is particularly in charge of them , but some awesome leadership has emerged nonetheless .   generally quite a few months in advance , one teammate will get the ball rolling by opening up a doodle poll , wufoo form or google spreadsheet to pin down dates and location .   for our most recent retreat , buffer ’s fifth , you can see how the vote went as we decided to head to the beautiful city of sydney .   first the location nominations :   then the vote :   tools that help us here : wufoo , google drive , doodle , google forms     getting there   booking airfare   once the destination is settled ( and a giant email thread of excitement ensues ) , all teammates are cleared to shop for their own plane ticket and expense it at their leisure .   we do this to give everyone the freedom to plan their own way here .   some of us choose to travel before or after the retreat — for instance joel and brian spent a few weeks before the retreat traveling in asia .   we give giant props to hipmunk and our awesome team at foresight for making the airfare and expense process easy !   tools that help us here : hipmunk , hackpad for sharing flight and city details   cost : about $ 2,200 per person , or $ 57,200 total   one note here : teammates who are still in their 45 - day trial period are not quite eligible for retreats until they finish up the 45 days and come on full time , which has led to some exciting close calls ( dan hopped aboard a plane to south africa with less than a week ’s notice ! ) .   this time around we were able to meet two new teammates : jose and thomas !   finding a place to stay   while we book our plane tickets , a few of amazing teammates begin to focus on where we ’ll all stay once we arrive .   we have tried a few different types of accommodations on retreats . in cape town , we stayed all together in a few big houses , and i think thailand might have been similar . in new york , mostly out of necessity , we switched to individual hotel rooms — and that carried on to sydney as well .   generally , we look for an affordable spot with great wifi . breakfast is handy , too !   in sydney we stayed in the cambridge hotel , where everyone was incredibly lovely and accommodating — especially on the day when we took over the hotel restaurant ( and later , conference room ) to work en masse answering customer tickets following a google+ situation we accidentally created !   tools that help us here : google sheets for sharing hotel info   cost : $ 39,992     where we work   a final piece of the puzzle is where we ’ll all work when we get together .   in cape town , we simply made space around the common areas of our shared houses to get work done . ( poolside writing was nice ! )   in new york , we made the switch to a coworking space near our hotel and really enjoyed the experience of working together at chinatown ’s projective space .   for our sydney trip , we returned to the coworking scene and had an amazing week at hub sydney .   getting a coworking space is an amazing luxury and does so much to make sure that we have time and space to fully connect with teammates even as we stay in individual hotel rooms . it also keeps us from overrunning hotel lobbies ( though we still did a bit of that in sydney ) and generally gives us a big enough space to hold a meetup !   cost : $ 3,510   meeting the community   one of my very favorite things we ’ve added to buffer retreats beginning in new york last fall is the addition of a community meetup wherever we go .   our community - focused teammates nicole and åsa did a killer job of planning this event in sydney so that there were snacks , drinks , cool tunes , some q & a time , buffer swag , and plenty of new people to meet and greet .   here ’s a time - lapse look at the meetup fun :     our big , big thanks to invision for sponsoring our beer and cider !   tools that help us here : social media for getting the word out , eventbrite for ticket management   cost :   drinks : aud $ 835.56 ( thanks , invision ! )   food : aud $ 1791.60   other expenses : aud $ 75   swag : $ 180   event space : aud $ 688.88   total : $ 2,816   working together throughout the week   how we work together seems to be a bit different on every retreat . in thailand ( before my time ) , the group worked on one big project all week , from which buffer for business came !   in cape town , each team was focused on smaller projects , and we had daily stand - up meetings with all teammates each morning to share our progress .   in new york , the focus switched more to culture . in between regular work sessions , we had in - depth talks about topics like our values and how we might grow .   having embraced a new philosophy of no managers , based on the book reinventing organizations , before our sydney retreat , things took a different form once again as we tried a model that mimicked the barcamp “ unconference ” vibe .   anyone could sign up to lead a session or roundtable , and team members could attend as many or as few sessions as they liked . topics ranged from happiness to side projects to css / html and how buffer runs .   the general consensus here was that many of us felt slightly less productive than we normally would have been , but that the chance to talk and learn together in person and discuss ideas face - to - face more than made up for the deficit .   the “ unconference ” format proved to be a really cool concept that we might try to build upon for our next retreat — we’ve even considering opening up some of the sessions to the community or anyone who might be interested . what do you think ?   extras and fun stuff   it ’s not all work and no play when we get together for buffer retreats . we always try to make a good bit of time to hang out face - to - face and share lots of fun times together .   in sydney , we got in heaps of amazing group activities , including a team dinner , a trip to taronga zoo ( koalas ! ) , taking in an amazing outdoor movie together , and a catamaran cruise along the sydney harbour .   in keeping with the “ unconference ” theme , there were also other additional activities that team members could choose from , including climbing the sydney harbour bridge , a piano concert at the sydney opera house and surf lessons on bondi beach .   tools that help us here : we use facebook messenger to keep up - to - date with everyone whereabouts and activities throughout the week   costs :     outdoor movie : aud $ 992   taronga zoo : aud $ 993   catamaran cruise : aud $ 1,200   team dinner : aud $ 2000   lunch catering : aud $ 403.40   bridge climb : aud $ 2728   surf lessons : aud $ 1360   team t - shirts : aud $ 1037.45   total : $ 8,356   grand total : $ 111,874   a quick note on additional costs : we tend to try to make retreats as “ no cost ” as possible for team members , since we all still pay rent / mortgages back home while we ’re on them , and little things can quickly add up .   so anyone is free to expense a breakfast , a taxi ride , a sim card , a dinner — whatever they feel is appropriate — throughout the week . in this way , the overall accounting here is a bit low , as individual reimbursement requests are still coming through for this latest trip .   what ’s next ?   where will we go next ? who knows ! the next retreat will be july - ish , and we ’ve already begun preliminary voting and planning . it feels like a more remote , wintery type environment might be trending now . here ’s how the nominations are going so far :   so that ’s a bit of a look inside the retreat process for buffer ! i hope it might answer a few questions for you !   i also need to mention that åsa and rodolphe are our current retreat heroes and did so much , from accommodations to fun events , to make the sydney retreat a once - in - a - lifetime memory .   have you ever gone on a company retreat ? what did you do , and how was the experience ? i ’d love to hear your feedback and tips as we begin planning our next journey .',\n",
              " 'why you should share your blog post more than once on social media : the case for reposting content . reposting the same content on social media can be quite a controversial topic . some people do n’t like it at all , while others advocate it strongly .   for buffer ’s social media accounts , we regularly do this . we found this to work surprisingly well and thought it might be interesting to explore the topic in a more analytical way .   here is some interesting data around republishing your content multiple times on social media . simply looking at the latest social media stats , there seems to be good case for doing so . some people also call this the “ guy kawasaki”-technique for using social media . looking at his massive following , it seems to be working well !   why should you repost the same content ? 3 big reasons :   first of all , let ’s see what kind of benefits you can get from reposting your content multiple times .   1 . more traffic   the first , and perhaps most obvious , reason to share your content more than once is to drive more traffic that the initial share .   tom tunguz did an experiment on his own blog to show how reposting the same content helped him to boost traffic .   to get an idea of how many people were seeing and sharing his posts , tom looked at the number of retweets he got when tweeting a link to one of his blog posts . we can assume from this that actual visits to his posts increased with each retweet , as well .   with each subsequent tweet of an existing blog post , tom noticed that he got around 75 % as many retweets as the time before .   what was really interesting here is that even though he got more retweets each time , this was directly proportionate to the number he got originally .   this graph shows the average number of retweets tom got the first time he tweeted , and the second .   he found that the blog posts that only got retweeted a couple of times on average when he first shared them only got a couple of retweets the second time , as well .   blog posts that were intially retweeted a lot , however , got quite a few retweets when he shared them again , as well .   we ’ve also noticed that tweeting posts from the buffer blog more than once gives us more traffic and more engagement ( favorites , retweets ) .   here ’s an example where we ’ve done this :   2 . hit multiple time zones   guy kawasaki is known for posting the same content multiple times , and one reason he advocates doing this is to reach your followers in different time zones . he ’s found that this increases the traffic to his content , particularly when tweeting the same link several times :   the reason for repeated tweets is to maximize traffic and therefore advertising sales . i ’ve found that each tweet gets approximately the same amount of clickthroughs . why get 600 page views when you can get 2,400 ?   guy generally repeats tweets of his blog posts ( with minor variations ) four times each , to hit different time zones :   we provide content repeatedly because people live in different time zones and have different social media habits .   even if you only tweet the same thing a couple of times , if you spread out your tweets ( or facebook posts , or updates on other social networks ) , you ’ll be able to reach more people who might have otherwise missed out on seeing your content .   3 . reach your new followers   something we ’ve noticed at buffer is that a lot of our posts are still relevant months after we publish them . the other thing that changes after we publish a post is that more people follow us on social networks , so if we repost content from our blog that ’s six months old , many of our followers will be seeing it for the first time , so they ’ll get value out of it even though it ’s old content .   you can use a tool like twitter counter to track your follower growth , so you know when it ’s a good time to repost some of your older content .   making it work   if you want to try this out on your own content , here are some things that have worked well for us at buffer .   make sure to reframe the content each time   something we try to do each time we post a piece of content is to slightly reframe it so we ’re not just repeating ourselves .   here ’s an example of how we might do that on facebook :   first , we post the actual link   then we go and post only one image to explain part of the post   this way we can sometimes get double or even triple the amount of engagement by highlighting different elements of the content each time we post it .   first we publish it as a link :   the 7 biggest , counterintuitive social media mistakes you may be making http://t.co/euqc545rrz     — buffer ( @buffer ) november 25 , 2013   then , through twitter ’s new expanded images feature , we publish it as an image and reframing it :   men are more likely to read blogs at night . here’re 6 more counterintuitive social media facts http://t.co/3qrp3l4ady pic.twitter.com/apbibrkqkd     — buffer ( @buffer ) november 25 , 2013   you can simply right click any image on the web with buffer to share a new image post on twitter or facebook , that according to the latest social media statistics , will garner significant more clicks , retweets and favorites .   we ’ll also try slightly different wording each time we post the same thing , like this :   test different headlines   since we post the same content to twitter multiple times , we take advantage of this opportunity to test out what headline works best for the blog post .   here ’s how we usually run that kind of experiment :   find 2 headlines for an article that you think will perform well . tweet both of these headlines at roughly the same time , at least 1 hour apart . here i ’ve found that doing the 2 tweets both in the am or both in the pm works best – 9 am is much more similar to 10 am , then say 12 pm is to 1 pm . so going with clear “ morning ” or “ afternoon ” times is crucial . compare the data for which headline to settle on .   and here ’s an example of the analytics from a headline experiment we did on this blog post :   first tweet :   second tweet :   the second tweet clearly performed better as we found out through our social analytics and buffer ’s algorithm also identified it as a top tweet . in fact , you can clearly see that the second headline got double the number of clicks .   when we see a big difference in engagement on a different headline like that , we usually go back to the original post and change the title itself ( the url never changes , just the heading of the blog post ) , so this can be a really useful learning experience for us , as well as helping us share our content with more people .   image credits : tomasz tunguz   p.s. if you liked this post , you might also like how twitter ’s new expanded images increase clicks , retweets and favorites and 7 big , recent twitter changes you should know about to optimize your tweeting',\n",

              " 'using links to named anchors to improve your search result snippets . a very , very long time ago google announced their support for a new feature , that they referred to as “ jump to : ” links .   how do named anchors work ?   the jump to links used internal “ named ” anchor links found in the html of a document . think , “ quick navigation ” links to move you to a relevant section heading on a page .   a url would use a # fragment in an href link . by inserting an i d name in a container , that link would jump you to a point on the page . if you ’re a web standards person , this is a named anchor link . if you ’re google , this is a “ jump to ” link .   for example :   page.html#my-example   these features were first put to use almost a decade ago , but my friend cindy more recently coined the phrase “ fraggles ” .   i think that has a nicer ring to it than named anchors or jump to links !     first , ensure that long , multi - topic pages on your site are well - structured and broken into distinct logical sections . second , ensure that each section has an associated anchor with a descriptive name ( i.e. , not just \\' section 2.1 \\' ) , and that your page includes a \\' table of contents \\' which links to the individual anchors . google webmaster central   this article explains how to get “ jump to ” links in your search result snippets , and how to quickly modify them using search console ( much in the same way you can do this with your answer boxes . )   how to get jump to links in your search snippets   google advises to use “ distinct , logical sections ” on our pages .   review each of your page sub - titles to make sure they ’re as relevant as you can make them to actual search queries .   it ’s nice to make your headings relevant to the types of search query you ’re targeting on your page , so take your keyword research into account when you ’re designing your headings . obviously , if you ’re writing a decent document or online guide , this part of the process tends to happen naturally .   have a list of those headings handy for this next step :   i tend to use h2 heading containers to structure the main topic areas of my document , but this works with h3 and strong containers too .   create a “ quick navigation ” table while carefully considering your anchor id names to insert into your links .   here ’s a sample used on my robots.txt article :   < strong > quick navigation</strong > < ol > < li><a href=\"#page - level - indexing\">using meta robots</a></li > < li><a href=\"#x - robots - tag\">using x - robots - tag</a></li > < li><a href=\"#robots.txt\">set crawl directives in robots.txt</a></li > < li><a href=\"#testing\">test robots.txt</a></li > < li><a href=\"#removing - content\">removing content via google search console</a></li > < li><a href=\"#examples\">real life examples qa</a></li > < /ol >   as soon as you ’ve built your quick navigation links , you can work through your document adding unique id ’s into each of the headings , like this :   < h2 id=\"page - level - indexing\">setting page level indexing directives with meta robots</h2 >   now you ’re done , so just test your document and make sure you ’re happy with the links .   using fetch as googlebot to update your snippets   this is the old desktop snippet . as you can see , the links are somewhat hidden as google is forced to trim the anchor text links down in the search results page :   those snippets are generated from the ( previous version of my ) quick navigational links :   so , i created a newer , trimmed down version :   then , go to ( old ) search console and use fetch as googlebot :   and , in the time it took me to update this blog post , your jump to links are updated in the search results :   it ’s the pace at which google updates things now that really astounds me . back in 2009 when this article was first written , we ’d need to wait days for these things to change . astounding .',\n",
              " 'what is a pr hook & how do you know when you have one ? . for this reason , it can be hard to know where to begin . while there ’s no definitive process to creating the perfect pr hook , the following steps are key in making sure your hook will be successful in serving up an ace .   a hook can come in many formats – it could be your headline , an image , a video , a thought - provoking question , an amazing statistic or even a pr stunt deliberately designed to add newsworthy value to a client ’s message .   “ a hook is a way of presenting your news or story that will stimulate interest from your chosen media audience . ”   so , how can you make sure your message has the best possible chance of competing with every other email a journalist receives each day ? the simple answer is to make sure you have not just a compelling story , but also a strong hook .   “ advertising is what you pay for , publicity is what you pray for . ”   advertising allows you to serve your own message , meaning you have complete creative control , know exactly where it will be placed and how it will be communicated . pr is the opposite . your message must appeal as a piece of stand - alone news for editors to run a story on , however they see fit . in other words :   when playing tennis , if you ca n’t hit the ball over the net then you wo n’t get the point . journalists receive hundreds , sometimes thousands , of emails a day , and so making sure your email gets seen can feel a bit like playing for the break point .   step 1 : can you clearly define your message ?   remember that it ’s the audience ’s job to absorb and remember the message , not try and decipher it .   if you ca n’t clearly define your own message then you ’re not yet ready to start thinking about what your hook could be .   step 2 : what is your objective ?   pr objectives generally come back to one or a combination of the following :   raise awareness and inform   change attitudes   or , increase conversion rate   you ’ll need to have a clear understanding of what your business or client ’s objectives are before developing a pr hook .   the main reason for this is that your hook will affect what type of publications run your story , and the publications that run your story will affect the success of your objectives because of the audience that reads them .   for example , if your objective is to raise awareness amongst a specific target audience then you ’ll want to target publications that are read by that specific target audience .   throughout the development of your pr hook you should be referring to your original objectives , and be asking the question : will this hook help achieve my objectives ?   step 3 : have you done your research ?   you need to make sure you have a thorough understanding of the following points :   the media outlets that you ’re targeting and their target audiences   the journalists you ’re targeting   the industry your client or business operates in   what your business or your client ’s competitors are doing   having a good understanding of the media landscape is key – journalists want to write about the topics their readers care about .   keeping up to date with news , insights and issues within the industry that your business or client operates is also essential to developing hooks . if you can be the first to spot an issue , you can be the first to solve it and that could even be your hook . it ’ll also give you the opportunity to respond reactively to new trends .   here at builtvisible , we collate news from the industries in which our clients operate into round - ups . these round - ups are shared with the team to ensure everyone is up - to - date on current industry trends , news and insights , as well as being able to jump on any obvious pitches .   step 4 : do n’t tell me , show me   if you are going to communicate your story through email , then think about how visuals could be used as a hook .   journalists and bloggers are often more likely to cover your story if it features an image . this is no surprise as the human brain can register an image in as little as 13 milliseconds , making it likely that images and videos will better engage a journalist .   step 5 : is your hook timely , relevant and unique ?   if your story is n’t new , you should think of a fresh twist or angle , make a national story local , be a contrarian or personalise the data .   while it ’s important to be creative with your hook , there also needs to be a clear link between your hook , story and business or client . if the hook just seems like an attention grabber and nothing more , it wo n’t be relevant and might confuse your audience . it ’ll also make it unlikely to be remembered in relation to your business or client .   do n’t rush to it , if there ’s a big event taking place consuming most of the media ’s attention then it ’s best not to launch in that time . however , if there ’s a big event , awareness day , national day or social media trend that links to your story then think about how your hook could take advantage of that .   nhs give blood # missingtype campaign   in 2015 , give blood was experiencing record lows in the number of people signing up to donate blood for the first time .   in a decade , the number of had fallen by a staggering 24.4 % to the point where 204,000 new people were needed to attend a donation session to replace those who could n’t donate anymore .   to combat this issue , give blood launched # missingtype during national blood week , a media relations and digital lead campaign .   the objectives were simple :   reverse a trend in the decline of new blood donors over the last decade . call for new donors to ensure blood donation for future generations .   give blood asked brands , organisers and influencers across england to remove the letters a , b and o , the letters that make up blood groups , from the logos on their websites , signage and social media names . most importantly , give blood requested participants not to explain why they had removed these letters .   it was later revealed that the letters had been removed to highlight the need for new donors , and to raise awareness of the blood shortage the nhs was experiencing .   story : not enough new people are signing up to donate blood .   hook : a publicity stunt communicating give blood ’s message and acting as a disruptive tactic to generate word of mouth quickly .   the campaign secured 689 pieces of coverage reaching over three million people . however , the main proof point of success is that not only were people joining in , removing letters and spreading the word , the increased number of people registering to donate blood was astounding . in just under 10 days from launching the campaign over 30,000 people had registered to donate blood .   the campaign directly relates to give blood ’s key objective of raising awareness and launching in national blood week made it timely and relevant .   the hook of visually representing what a difference the missing letters , or # missingtype , made to everyday life was unique causing brands to join in , regardless of whether they had originally been asked to participate , and the media want to run give blood ’s story .   it ’s key to remember that your hook is n’t primarily aimed at consumers , your aim is to convince journalists that your story is worth covering and that their readers will benefit from what you have to say . if you ’ve stayed true to your objectives , researched the current media landscape , thought about how you could be unique and have taken into consideration timings and relevancy , then there ’s no reason why it wo n’t . so , while there ’s no definitive process , there is a formula that , if followed , will craft the perfect hook to hang your story on .   game , set , match .',\n",

members . for example , if you have a membership extension which changes user role to “ member ” when someone purchases a membership , you can use a role condition with value “ member ” to make sure that only members are eligible .   how will my customers know about the sale , special offer etc ?   when developing this extension , our initial focus was on actually making all the different pricing adjustments , discounts and fees work . you can make almost any pricing strategy work but usually your customers are going to see their savings after adding some product to cart or going through the checkout . after getting the actual logic work well , we shifted our attention to the tools that help your customers learn about your deals and sales – you can opt to display a quantity pricing table for bulk and tiered pricing rules or make product prices throughout the shop reflect simple pricing rules . more promotional tools are planned for future releases .   does it support … scenario ?   9 out of 10 times ( maybe even 99 out of 100 ) when we get this question the answer is yes . this has to do with how this extension is organized – it is not limited to a few settings that do very specific things , instead it offers multiple pricing / discount / fee methods with dozens of conditions and useful settings which can all be mixed and combined to come up with virtually any product pricing rule , cart discount or checkout fee . if you want to be sure that your desired scenario is supported , simply check out examples on this page , search the comments section , our knowledge base or just ask us . but have no doubt that such simple pricing rules as “ buy 2 get 1 half price ” , “ buy 10 + with 15 % discount ” or “ 3 for $ 9.99 ” are supported .   is it compatible with … extension ?   more often than not this extension is compatible with other woocommerce extensions as it uses standard price hooks to change prices and standard methods to add discounts / fees . there may be some edge cases where compatibility is not achieved out of the box – in these cases we either come up with a solution within a reasonable time frame or provide clients with a full refund .   does it support wpml ?   wpml compatibility is still on our to - do list as of now .   does it support decimal quantities ?   decimal quantities are not supported and will not be supported in the future . this is due to some technical solutions in the plugin that do not work well with decimal quantities . these solutions enable some great functionality which would not be possible otherwise .   does it support multiple currencies ?   it depends on your specific needs . this extension is fully compatible with a few popular currency switcher plugins and will work fine out of the box . on the other hand , you wo n’t be able to set specific discounts for different currencies – you can only set them in base currency and get it converted automatically .   i installed this extension but run into a problem – what shall i do ?   head straight to our support site ! we have some self - help content that you can consult and will respond to your inquiry within 24 hours ( business days only ) if you opt to send us one . although this extension was developed to the highest standards and is constantly tested by thousands of users , there may be some edge cases , unique requirements or exotic server setups that have not surfaced to this date – we always keep an eye for them and value any feedback from our clients .   this plugin is super easy to use , works like it ’s advertised , the purchase price is fantastic and the support i ’ve received from the developer is second to none . i ca n’t recommend this plugin enough . – ndev777   rightpress offers not only a great product , but some of the best customer support on codecanyon . keep up the great work ! – antonnovikov   this is a fantastic and flexible plugin i ’ve recommended for several clients . the customer service is high quality and fast to boot – highly recommend , thanks guys ! – dnfs2000   changelog   version 2.4.5 , 11 september 2022 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ * feature -

              " 'the pros , cons , and costs of the top 10 content distribution platforms . welcome to the third post in our contently labs series , where we answer common questions we hear from current or prospective brand publishers . today ’s question : “ what are the best platforms for paid content distribution ? ”   creating high - quality branded content is very important , but when it comes to making sure your ad dollars are spent properly , understanding the best ways to get eyeballs on your content can be just as crucial to your success .   as part of our contently labs series , we ’re offering a deep dive into the costs , pros , and cons of the most popular platforms for distributing branded content . as gary vaynerchuk said , content may be king , but distribution is queen and runs the household .   note : all costs vary , depending on a number of factors tailored to your campaign . estimates come from our own case studies and online reports , but like with the bowflex , results most certainly vary .   outbrain   cpc : $ 0.25–$0.35   pros : currently , outbrain is probably the most well - known distribution service among its competitors taboola , nrelate , and disqus . the company has made an effort to care about quality and the invasiveness of their sponsored posts . near the end of 2012 , they banned companies that spammed readers with misleading headlines from their network , even though the move cut 25 percent of their revenue . they drive organic traffic , offer analytics , and target geographically .   cons : successful campaigns ultimately come down to trial and error . it ’s harder to predict results when you ca n’t target audiences as specifically as you can on facebook . ( more on that later . )   taboola   cpc : $ 0.25–$0.35 ; $ 0.75 for its network of top 30 sites   pros : taboola actually started as a video recommendation service , and their commitment to analyzing video and slideshow viewing habits for future consumption gives them a specific edge over similar companies that struggle to distribute visuals . and recently , taboola improved their services , letting clients have more control in post presentation . very similar to outbrain .   cons : see outbrain .   nativo   rather than a cpc , nativo charges a viewable cpm ( vcpm ): $ 10–$18   pros : nativo ’s programmatic platform may soon emerge as a game - changer when it comes to scaling sponsored content that runs on publisher sites . instead of just placing links that take readers to an outside site , the company engineers homepage placements and article pages to fit natively within publications such as entrepreneur.com . this strategy makes it possible for a brand to distribute sponsored posts on multiple outlets without striking separate deals with each publication . nativo already works with an estimated 1,700 publishers , and their client list is fairly impressive .   cons : the nature of programmatic may also be nativo ’s biggest downside . the quality of the content could suffer , since publications are n’t communicating closely with brands to tailor their work to a unique audience . long - term diminished quality through programmatic could undermine native advertising ’s current success .   facebook sponsored posts   cpc : $ 0.50–$0.60   pros : facebook has a key advantage over other distributors : they ’ve amassed the most complete data set on their users , making it possible to target a very specific audience . brands and publishers can rest assured the right eyeballs will be on their content on facebook , and since facebook sponsored posts can be shared like any other post , they can spur on exponential results .   cons : due to the hyper - targeting advantages , the cost per click is more expensive than with services like outbrain and taboola . and as with other social traffic , even if you benefit from one popular piece of content , there is no correlation to future success . social shares drive a lot of one - off traffic . more importantly , while brands were once able to glean free advertising by reaching viewers who liked their pages , facebook announced plans to cut that traffic down to under 2 percent , “ holding the whole operation hostage , ” as valleywag put it . buying facebook sponsored posts might soon be mandatory for brands looking to reach their facebook following .   promoted tweets / promoted accounts   cpc : $ 0.50–$0.55   pros : twitter ’s promoted tweets blend well into the timeline . because of the seamless , native presentation , twitter ’s click - through rate ranges from 1–3 percent compared to about 0.12 percent for facebook . twitter also gives you options — you can promote tweets and accounts . when they bought mobile ad exchange mopub last fall , they made a strong move to target an audience that increasingly comes from mobile devices . recently , they ’ve improved the visuals for tweets , drawing attention to significantly larger thumbnails .   cons : even though twitter is popular among celebrities , it does n’t actually have a huge audience — facebook has five times as many users . twitter is great for some verticals , like marketing , media , and entertainment , but less ideal for others .   nrelate   cpc : $ 0.25–$0.30   pros : nrelate can be slightly cheaper than outbrain or taboola . the services are fairly similar , but their widget offers a lot of customizable options for thumbnail and text presentation .   cons : conversely , nrelate does n’t boast as sizable a publisher network as their competitors , making traffic harder to come by . you also ca n’t target readers geographically by state or city .   ( an earlier version of this article stated users could n’t target geographically , but you can target by country and region . )   disqus   cpc : $ 0.25–$0.30   pros : disqus has almost identical pros to nrelate .   cons : one detail worth noting : they do n’t offer analytics , so it ’s more difficult to understand what ’s working in real time . the product disqus supplies is similar to what competitors offer , but their lack of resources leaves a lot to be desired .   yahoo stream ads   cpc : $ 0.20–$0.30   pros : last year , yahoo started phasing out banner ads with stream ads , their own native product that blends into the site ’s news feed . the style of the embedded posts fits well with other editorial content , and yahoo has a chance to develop their offering into a worthwhile service if they let companies create quality content that relates to specific sections ( sports , entertainment , etc . ) .   cons : targeting is fairly limited , and the sponsored ad presentation wo n’t wow anyone with tiny thumbnails . distribution sites are learning quickly how clear , rich visuals can make native content much more appealing to readers , but yahoo has n’t adjusted their strategy . even though the platform is still young , yahoo has relied too heavily on direct response ads that are really just banner ads dressed in a native cloak . links to articles titled “ top 10 credit cards for excellent credit ” are not going to seriously engage anyone , and they ’ll inevitably encourage readers to tune out other sponsored content in the stream .   linkedin sponsored updates   cpc : $ 4   pros : linkedin ’s strongest asset is their network of professionals and executives . if you have a specific target , their sponsored updates can provide a lot of value . you can filter based on company , job title , location , etc . other distributors may yield more clicks , but linkedin has built up a platform that can yield the right clicks .   cons : because linkedin boasts an extensive professional network and incredibly specific targeting , they charge an arm , a leg , and whatever organs you ’ll offer in exchange for a click . there ’s certainly value in a linkedin click , but only for a client capable of writing bigger checks . and from an aesthetic standpoint , their sponsored ads are n’t very customizable — images must fit a standard thumbnail size .   other native social   tumblr , pinterest , and instagram all offer newly minted paid options for increasing your brand ’s reach , but the content needs to be natively crafted for that platform . you ’re simply not going to drive traffic to your brand ’s magazine using instagram ads , for example . still , they can be extremely effective if you ’re active on the platform ; the average sponsored post on tumblr , for instance , gets reblogged 10,000 times .   closing thoughts   the big distribution players are still figuring out how to showcase branded work in a way that appeals to readers without getting in their way , like traditional display . the finer points of this list will likely change over time , but we hope this guide answers questions and provides groundwork for important decision - making . after all , understanding the nuances of the distribution game could be the difference between getting ignored or standing out .   previously in contently labs :   7 keys to great seo for content marketers   what ’s the difference between b2b and b2c content marketing ?   how red bull , amex , and dove win by proudly branding their content   contently arms brands with the tools and talent to become great content creators . learn more .',\n",

              " 'understanding ad campaigns with inaccurate data . since the dawn of the digital age , companies have been striving for better ways to track advertising efforts , particularly the way dollars equate to returns from those efforts . as marketers and advertisers , we track anything we can get a pixel on , from clicks to conversions . and we pay special attention to kpi ’s which correlate with profit , which include : revenue , roas ( return on ad spend ) and cpa type metrics .   some events , such as an “ add - to - cart ” and purchase values , can be tracked on your website no matter the source of the visit , whereas roas and cpa ( conversion cost ) metrics imply an advertising cost involved ( meaning they ’re often attributed to places you ’ve spent advertising dollars , such as adwords & facebook ) .   but no matter where the traffic or sales come from , there always seems to be a problem with how accurate the data actually is ! and with good reason ; it ’s virtually impossible to get 100 % accuracy in reporting metrics of any kind .   with so many ways for the data to be off , we ’ll try and shore up some understanding as to what could be going on and some things you can do to fix it .   lack of tracking   having a lack of tracking is exactly that ; a lack of visits , sessions , conversions , or events being tracked . however it ’s not always a lack of tracking code . there are many reasons these instances are not being tracked .   form vs direct email   with signup and quote forms being so useful in tracking leads , it ’s no surprise that listing a direct email on a website as a primary call - to - action has become a thing of the past . despite this , however , many advertisers will still list direct emails somewhere on their site , even if they have a form as a primary cta .   it may be difficult to assign a value to a form , but it ’s pretty close to impossible to assign a value to an email . if you still have email addresses listed on your website , please consider replacing that with a trackable form or a button that leads to a form page .   website call tracking   phone calls are notoriously the hardest things to track since the transaction is not technically happening online . it ’s happening over the phone , which has traditionally had a total disconnect from any digital tracking . for over a decade , there have been third party call - tracking services , but they tended to be very expensive and the reporting produced was often not granular enough to track keyword - level settings .   even if you could get call tracking , it was usually pretty difficult to get any usable data due to restrictive timeframes . the way these software companies would offer this level of tracking without having to own millions of phone numbers would be to rotate out phone numbers from a pool every 12 - 24 hours . this meant that you were only getting reporting if someone actually called within that time frame .   nowadays , google provides website call tracking , which dynamically changes the phone number on your website if it sees that the visitor came from an adwords ad . it provides no reporting from other sources , but if the bulk of your ad spend comes from adwords , , this becomes a very attractive option . also , the numbers last for 6 month , so if your customer decides they would call you again after 5 months , the phone number will still work !   call tracking from ads   similar to website call tracking , google offers something called call extensions , where you see the phone number in the ad itself . it ’s popularity amongst local emergency - type services is fully warranted , especially if all the phone calls have similar average values . for instance , if you are a garage door repair person , you could set up a call extension and then only pay when someone calls the google number on your ad .   this type of tracking is not practical for businesses that have customers who would need to see the website first before calling , but if you are a dui lawyer , a locksmith , a plumber , or are in a similar “ emergency ” industry , adding these to your ads would provide a lot of insight to which keywords and ads are driving phone calls . most importantly , you can get a firm grasp on how your ad dollars are working in your account .   ecommerce tracking   although this has gotten much easier over the years , there are still a great number of ecommerce advertisers who are not correctly tracking ecommerce events within google analytics . this is usually because ecommerce tracking requires a separate script which sometimes needs to be modified to pull in specific transaction data such as the items purchased or a transaction amount .   many open - source and hosted shopping cart providers have streamlined the integration of ecommerce tracking . most are set to only use the account id from google tag manager or universal analytics . the parameters that extract the transaction details are already built into the cart platform and are then sent to google .   bing and facebook also use their own ecommerce scripts to drive report purchase data from transactions .   discrepancy   a discrepancy in the data is different than “ flying blind ” in that you are typically working with some data already ; the numbers just do n’t seem to be adding up correctly . here are a few of the most common themes around data tracking discrepancies .   differences between analytics ’ sessions and adwords clicks   i think most advertisers have given up trying to get the data from adwords and analytics to match . as long as the session and clicks are reasonably close , then it ’s probably close enough ! but if you have ever wondered why sessions are clicks always differ , there are a few reasons .   first , it ’s important to know that clicks are one - time events that occur when someone clicks once on an ad , while a session occurs over the entire duration of a visit . so if your customer clicks your ad multiple times , clicks on an ad initially but comes back directly , or does n’t wait for the page to load fully , you will see a discrepancy between clicks and sessions . also , if adwords reports “ invalid clicks ” you will likely have those clicks filtered from adwords , but the session will still be reported in google analytics .   revenue vs total conversion value ( and auto - tagging )   another area of discrepancy between adwords and analytics is on the topic of revenue and how it is reported . analytics reports revenue as revenue while adwords uses the metric called total conversion value . the key difference is that revenue is always revenue whereas total conversion value can be revenue ( if that data is pulled in from google analytics ) or it can also be an assigned value which is the same for every type of conversion .   neither is better or worse . it ’s all about whether they are used together or independently . setting up the auto - tagging feature in adwords is great if you want this data to match , as revenue data can then be piped in from analytics to display in adwords .   regardless of which methods you use to calculate total conversion value , this indicator is “ key ” in measuring performance of keywords , ads , and campaigns . optimized bidding strategies can be set to leverage total conversion value so be sure to set it up correctly using the method you choose .   troubleshooting https and tracking in ga   one of the big themes of the internet this year are cyberattacks and the move toward ssl encryption on all hosted websites . many online businesses have already migrated to the https protocol . during that migration , there have to be changes made within analytics to specify https from http . not doing so could cause a discrepancy .   to make this change , log into google analytics , go to admin > property settings and change the protocol under default url .   another common issue to surface around the change is when advertisers forget to point their ads to the new protocol https . in this case there is often a server - side redirect in place to send the visitor to the correct page , but because the session was redirected , it can lose some information ( including the referred source ) . this discrepancy could show up in many ways , but usually you would notice traffic being attributed to the wrong source .   missing picture   the last section pertains to inaccuracies in the reporting that are caused by looking at a limited view of the total reporting available . this happens all the time , mostly because by default , platforms are set to show a limited view . in the end , it ’s up to us to dig deep enough into the reporting in order to see the entire picture .   first / last click attribution   by far , the hottest topic in pay per click advertising is attribution . attribution is how we define where the conversion or event came from . by default , google adwords reports the last click which contributed to the event or sale . but often , ppc managers are interested in seeing the keywords and ads that drove the initial visit .   looking at the larger picture , there could have been several keywords , ads , and campaigns that led to the conversion . with a greater emphasis on remarketing campaigns , we see that there can be several steps in the buying cycle . it is a mistake to view campaigns as a single linear path , when there is likely a much deeper story to each conversions . attribution helps us to see this more clearly .   notice how in this assisted conversions report ( google analytics ) , there are more assisted conversions than those that came from direct conversions ( last click ) . however in the paid search row , there are more assisted conversions , but given the exact timeframe adwords would not report those that were not a direct conversion . this is an important piece of information for understanding how your website and business actually drives conversions .   other models for attribution   there are any other models for click attribution besides first click and last click . here is a whole post on adwords attribution models .   cross device attribution   in the same way that conversions can come to be attributed to various keywords and campaigns at different stages of the conversion cycle , they can also be attributed to various devices . cross device attribution can tell you if and how your customers use technology differently as they near the conversion event .   multi - channel funnels   while you are getting familiar with your deeper analytics reporting , it might be a good idea to take a look at multi - channel funnels . this shows you the various paths someone has taken in each of your conversions . do n’t be surprised if you end up seeing a few of these …   this was not photoshopped ! only cropped . and it is a great reminder that no matter how we see our data , the picture is almost always bigger .   as good as it gets …   reporting accurate data can seem as fruitless as reporting the weather sometimes . when you ’re telling yourself that there is no point to digging deeper , know that there is a clearer picture when you when you cleanup the lack of tracking or discrepancies within the tracking . then it ’s just up to you to look in the right places so you can get the bigger picture of what is happening and how your site drives conversions and sales .   with all that said , know it ’s never 100 % accurate . just do all the things listed above and you should be in much better shape to make key decisions in your advertising .',\n",
              " \"blogging 101 : the abc 's of starting a blog from scratch . blogging has evolved in so many ways since its earliest days nearly 20 years ago in the late 90s and early days of the internet . we ’ve gone from simple hard - coded html pages created by the early blog pioneers to hundreds of millions of individual blogs online today .   whereas 20 years ago , most people would ’ve asked what a blog is , today it ’s widely accepted and understood that many people have a blog . that ’s especially true for generations x and y who were coming of age and growing up with the advent of the web .   but one thing that ’s still not widely understood is that blogs are not just an online journal – they are fueling one of the most powerful shifts in small business perhaps ever in the history of the world .   blogs are the difference between advertising with infomercials to mail educational dvds to customers and the ability to sell a digital download directly to customers all over the world , instantly . blogs are the difference between teaching an art workshop in your small hometown to the three people who were interested and being able to teach art to thousands of people at the same time without having to leave your house .   blogs have changed everything about what ’s possible for a budding entrepreneur , young or old . and it ’s the hope , the opportunity , and the aspiration that comes with that reality that attracts so many people to get started as bloggers , even now . there have never been so many blogs online as there are today and that number will only continue to grow . what better time is there to get started than right now ?   before you do , you should know : the game has changed . it ’s no longer enough to build a quick website and haphazardly post your thoughts here and there . there ’s too much noise coming from every direction to break through by simply hoping and aspiring to be great .   breaking through the noise today requires careful thought and strategy . it requires you to intentionally choose a topic to cover persistently and an audience to serve like your business depends on it ( because it does ) . it requires you to plan ahead for how you ’ll turn that blog into a business ( a blog is n’t a business in and of itself , after all ) , what platform you ’ll use , and what you ’ll write about .   more than anything , making it as a blogger today requires more than tactics . for beginners , blogging 101 appears to be as much about the understanding of how the internet works – marketing funnels , email marketing , metrics tracking , conversion rates , opt - in forms , affiliate marketing , ads , and all of the other things you think you ’re supposed to know – as anything . and that ’s why so many bloggers lose their way .   blogging is also about the craft . it ’s about the thing you choose to write about day after day and week after week . it ’s about the work you put in to become more of an expert than 80 % of the people in the world when it comes to your topic . it ’s about the long hours of research , writing , and editing . it ’s about caring enough to serve your audience with the best content on the web for your topic .   your job is n’t to start a blog . your job is to start a blog that creates change in the people who read it . that ’s going to take real work , and it ’s going to take a relentless focus on honing your craft . but if you can approach it with the right attitude , you just might find that your blog turns into a business that turns into your full - time career doing work you believe in .   so , are you ready ? this month ’s issue walks you through blogging 101 . there ’s plenty of competition , but there will never be a better time to get started . so go , do n’t delay another second . you have work to do .   happy writing !\",\n",

              " 'how to write headlines : a classic guide to hook more readers in 2022 . learning how to write headlines is critical . your headline is the first , and perhaps only , impression you make on a prospective reader .   without a headline or post title that turns a browser into a reader , the rest of your words may as well not even exist . but a headline can do more than simply grab attention .   a great headline can also communicate a full message to its intended audience , and it absolutely must lure the reader into your persuasive writing .   this epic guide to headline writing will show you the way …   how do you write headlines ?   at its essence , a compelling headline must promise some kind of benefit or reward for the reader , in trade for the valuable time it takes to read more .   in the copywriter ’s handbook , copywriter bob bly sets forth eight time - tested headline categories that compel action and rake in sales .   let ’s take a look at each .   1 . direct headlines   direct headlines go straight to the heart of the matter , without any attempt at cleverness . bly gives the example of pure silk blouses – 30 percent off as a headline that states the selling proposition directly . a direct blog post title might read free ebook : seo simplified .   2 . indirect headlines   an indirect headline takes a more subtle approach when you ’re learning how to write headlines . it uses curiosity to raise a question in the reader ’s mind , which the body copy answers . often a double meaning is utilized , which is useful online .   an article might have the headline fresh bait works best and yet have nothing to do with fishing , because it ’s actually about writing timely content that acts as link bait .   3 . news headlines   a news headline is pretty self - explanatory , as long as the news itself is actually , well … news . a product announcement , an improved version , or even a content scoop can be the basis of a compelling news headline . think introducing digital copywriter .   4 . how to headlines   the how to headline is everywhere , online and off , for one reason only — it works like a charm . bly says that “ many advertising writers claim if you begin with the words how to , you ca n’t write a bad headline . ” an example would be , umm … oh yes … the title of this post .   looking for content marketing services ? digital commerce partners is the agency division of copyblogger , and we specialize in delivering targeted organic traffic for growing digital businesses . learn more   5 . question headlines   a question headline must do more than simply ask a question . it must be a question that , according to bly , the reader can empathize with or would like to see answered . he gives this example from psychology today : do you close the bathroom door even when you ’re the only one home ?   6 . command headlines   the command headline boldly tells the prospect what he needs to do , such as exxon ’s old put a tiger in your tank campaign . bly indicates that the first word should be a strong verb demanding action , such as subscribe to copyblogger today !   7 . reasons why headlines   another effective technique when you ’re learning how to write headlines is the reason why model . your body text consists of a numbered list of product features or tips , which you then incorporate into the headline . for example , 100 reasons why wordpress beats squarespace .   it ’s not even necessary to include the words “ reasons why . ” this technique is actually the underlying strategy behind the ubiquitous blogger “ list ” posts , such as 8 ways to build blog traffic .   8 . testimonial headlines   finally , we have the testimonial headline , which is highly effective because it presents outside proof that you offer great value . this entails taking what someone else has said about you , your product or service , and using their actual words in your headline .   quotation marks let the reader know that they are reading a testimonial , which will continue in the body copy . a testimonial example from digital copywriter : “ ease that lonely feeling , that fear of making a mistake . ”   why you should always write your headline first   if you want to learn how to write headlines and even better content , start with the headline first .   you ’ll of course have a basic idea for the subject matter of your blog post or sales copy .   then , simply take that basic idea and craft a killer headline before you write a single word of the body content . why ?   your headline is a promise to readers . its job is to clearly communicate the benefit you ’ll deliver to the reader in exchange for their valuable time .   promises tend to be made before being fulfilled   writing your content first puts you in the position of having to reverse - engineer your promise . turn it around the other way and you have the benefit of expressly fulfilling the compelling promise you made with the headline .   this ultimately helps keep your content crisp and well - structured .   trying to fulfill a promise you have n’t made yet is tough , and often leads to a marginal headline and blog post introduction . and a poorly - crafted headline allows good deeds ( you know , like your content ) to go unnoticed .   headline writing that gets results   despite the fact that every copywriter and every journalist knows the power of headlines , many still underestimate their importance .   so , here are some anecdotes , facts , and guidelines .   they ’ll help you write even better headlines ( and also let you know how much you should focus on them ) .   the 50/50 rule of headlines   according to some of the best copywriters of all time , you should spend half of the entire time it takes to write a piece of persuasive content on the headline .   so if you have a blog post that is really important to you or your business , one that you really want people to read , you should downright obsess over your post title .   advertising legend david ogilvy knew the power of headlines , and how the headline literally determined whether the advertisement would get read . he rewrote this famous headline for an automobile advertisement 104 times :   “ at 60 miles an hour , the only thing you hear in the new rolls royce is the ticking of the dashboard clock … ”   master copywriter gene schwartz often spent an entire week on the first 50 words of a sales piece — the headline and the opening paragraph . those 50 words are the most important part of any persuasive writing , and writing them well takes time .   even for the masters .   the 80/20 rule of headlines   here are some interesting statistics .   on average , 8 out of 10 people will read headline copy , but only 2 out of 10 will read the rest . this is the secret to the power of the headline , and why it so highly determines the effectiveness of the entire piece .   the better the headline you craft with sharp proofreading and editing , the better your odds of beating the averages and getting what you ’ve written read by a larger percentage of people .   writing a great headline does n’t guarantee the success of your writing . the benefit conveyed in the headline still needs to be properly satisfied in the body copy , either with your content or your offer .   but great body content with a bad or even marginal headline is doomed to go largely unread .   subscribe now notice : javascript is required for this content .   how to write a headline   ready for a lesson on how to write headlines ?   we looked at the different categories of headlines that work above , and now we ’ll look at analytical techniques for producing great headlines .   the copywriting trainers at american writers & artists teach the four u ’s approach to writing headlines :   headlines , subheads , and bullets should :   be useful to the reader , provide him with a sense of urgency , convey the idea that the main benefit is somehow unique ; and do all of the above in an ultra - specific way .   in a classic issue of early to rise , clayton makepeace says to ask yourself six questions before you start to write your headline :   does your headline offer the reader a reward for reading ? what specifics could you add to make your headline more intriguing and believable ? does your headline trigger a strong , actionable emotion the reader already has about the subject at hand ? does your headline present a proposition that will instantly get your prospect nodding his or her head ? could your headline benefit from the inclusion of a proposed transaction ? could you add an element of intrigue to drive the prospect into your opening copy ?   makepeace ’s six questions combined with the basic structure of the four u ’s provide an excellent framework for writing spectacular headlines . and you ’ll note that just about any headline that satisfies the framework will fall into one of the eight categories you learned above .   it takes work and focus to learn how to write headlines , but the effort will make you a more effective writer and a more profitable businessperson .   what ’s in a killer “ how to ” article that gets attention ?   it ’s no secret that “ how to ” articles and blog posts are some of the most popular content online . people want useful information , and they ’ll reward you by promoting it to others when you provide it .   the biggest battle is getting enough people to read in the first place . and that battle is won or lost at the headline .   what ’s more , writing a killer “ how to ” headline will help you write even better “ how to ” content when you fulfill the headline promise you made to get people to read in the first place .   it ’s all about benefits   the crazy thing about the popularity of “ how to ” content is the fact that people do n’t really want to learn how to do anything else .   they ’ve got plenty to do already , thank you .   but it ’s exactly due to the crazy busy lives we lead that prompts us to seek out tips , tricks , and methods to make things better , easier , and ultimately happier for ourselves . focusing on the “ better , easier , and happier ” is the key . it ’s crucial to keep it in mind while mastering how to write headlines .   it ’s not that people are n’t smart enough to understand the implied benefits of learning how to do something . it ’s quite the opposite , actually . it ’s just that implied benefits do n’t prompt action like express benefits do .   get through scanning filters   people smartly employ aggressive attention filters when scanning headlines , and you ’ll get through the filters of a lot more people if you spell out the benefits rather than relying on implication .   plus , body content that focuses on benefits as well as procedures is more emotionally engaging , which leaves the reader feeling better satisfied at the conclusion of the piece .   it ’s been said that it ’s almost impossible to write a bad “ how to ” headline . that may be true , but what comes after those two magical words can make all the difference in the amount of attention and readership your writing gets .   let ’s take a look at the structure of a few famous “ how to ” headlines , and see if we ca n’t figure out why they work . then , we ’ll adapt them to new situations and content .   double the benefits , double the power   this may be the most famous “ how to ” headline ever :   how to win friends and influence people   before dale carnegie ’s classic book how to win friends and influence people was conventionally published , he sold it by mail order with that same title as the headline of the sales letter . certainly carnegie ’s content was compelling , but that headline is brilliant all by itself .   the headline structure is powerful . you ’ve got benefit number one right after “ how to , ” with another benefit following the word “ and . ” simple , right ?   deceptively so , as copywriter david garfinkel has pointed out . there is a subtle relationship between the first benefit and the second that suggests if you can achieve the first , you can automatically achieve the second .   in this case , that implication does n’t make sense — lots of people have friends and yet are completely lacking in influence . but that cause - and - effect relationship still likely helped carnegie achieve greatness with his home - study course , and later with the ubiquitous book .   it ’s much smarter from a credibility standpoint to use this structure when benefit one and benefit two are actually related . here are a few examples that garfinkel gives in his book .   how to save time and get things done ( time management coach )   how to get a better job and make more money ( recruiter )   how to save money and retire rich ( financial planner )   the dual benefit “ how to ” structure will always work if you logically link the two together and deliver relevant and substantive tips with your content . give it a try .   how to [ mundane task ] that [ rewarding benefit ]   this one look familiar ? 😉   it ’s often harder than you might think to extract the true benefits of learning how to do something . often , you can simply take a normal “ how to ” title and make it better simply by using the transition word “ that ” immediately following the subject matter of the tutorial .   once you add “ that , ” just ask yourself what the top benefit of your tutorial is . then figure out the best way to say it ( which usually means being as specific as possible ) .   how to get a mortgage that saves you money   how to get a mortgage that cuts your monthly payment in half   how to get a mortgage that gets you in your dream home while saving you $ 937 a month   leaving out the “ to ” works , too   want to increase the curiosity factor of your headline , while just about guaranteeing that you ’ll nail the primary benefit of your tutorial ?   start with “ how ” but leave out the “ to . ” you ’ll still be making a beneficial promise to your reader that will be fulfilled in the content , but the intrigue factor will be higher and your results perhaps even better .   let ’s look at these famous headlines :   how i improved my memory in one evening   how i made a fortune with a “ fool idea ”   how a new kind of clay improved my complexion in 30 minutes   those are pretty intriguing headlines , right ?   the more you focus on the benefits to the reader when you ’re learning how to write headlines , the more readers you ’ll have . and by touching on the beneficial aspects while laying out the procedural content , you ’ll have more happy readers at the conclusion of the article .   the cheater ’s guide to writing headlines   imagine the creative life of someone who ’s learned how to become a freelance writer … a solitary figure staring intently at a computer screen ( or out the window ) , flexing those mental muscles to create a killer headline out of thin air that will result in millions of dollars in sales .   well , maybe not .   a more likely scenario has the copywriter looking for inspiration in her collection of winning space ads and sales letters . she ’ll also consult books that consist of nothing more than collections of headlines proven to work .   enter : swipe files   these compilations are called swipe files , and they ’re worth their weight in gold when it comes to crafting great headlines .   why ?   because great headlines are constructed in certain time and money - tested ways that can be adapted into different contexts and re - used over and over .   anytime a promotion rakes in big bucks , you can bet copywriters and direct marketers will be studying , and saving , that headline for future reference .   in fact , swipe files ca n’t even really be considered cheating or a violation of marketing ethics . it ’s just the way it ’s done if you want to write effective copy , especially when starting out .   only once a copywriter has a true understanding of what works can they take a completely original approach . even then it ’s pretty rare to come up with a gangbuster headline that is 100 % unique .   you need to understand why certain headlines work   unfortunately , you ’ll still find people selling headline swipe files and even software programs that promise a “ fill - in - the - blank ” solution based on the “ greatest headlines ” ever written .   do n’t get suckered by this .   the problem with that approach should be obvious . if you do n’t understand why a particular headline works , you ’ll never be any good at writing them . plus , without real understanding , you ’ll likely choose the wrong “ formula ” for any given situation , which can cause even a well - written headline to fail .   but starting with these tested headline formulas can improve your content titles immediately , which in turn should translate into more readership and traffic .   next we ’ll examine keywords and why they ’re important in a headline . the answer may not be what you think .   do keywords in headlines really matter ?   the search engine optimization camp says keywords are the most important aspect of a blog post title .   how else will you rank high in the results and get more traffic , they say , if the right keywords are missing from the title ?   on the other hand , you ’ve got the purist “ write for humans ” camp , who collectively scoff at the notion of keyword research for headline writing .   what ’s the point of search optimized post titles if no one reads ( and links ) in the first place ?   well , here ’s the verdict .   keywords matter   but not necessarily for the reasons some seo folks think .   doing keyword research is a magical thing . it ’s a window into the mind of your target audience .   before search engines , there was no way to know the exact words that a large group of people would use when thinking about a certain topic .   oh sure , you could ask a small group of people , but anyone who has ever done focus groups will tell you that what people say in front of others is not the same as what they will really do .   so if you ’re learning how to write headlines , you should be doing search engine keyword research . because any great headline should speak in the language of the audience , while wrapped up in a time - tested structure that catches attention and offers value .   but it gets better   any seo pro worth listening to will tell you that you do n’t go after the most popular keywords . you target the niche phrases . they may result in less traffic individually , but there ’s a lot more of them , and less competition .   this is perfect for writing headlines for humans . the niche phrases are much more specific , and specificity makes for a much better headline . further , better headlines lead to writing better content .   google and other search engines really do want to reflect what ’s important to people . that ’s why links and anchor text are primary determinations of relevancy .   keywords matter for sensible seo , because when you speak the language of the audience , you attract more readers , more links , and yes … more relevant search traffic . both camps are right , for different reasons .   why some people almost always write great headlines   what are some of the characteristics of people who crank out content titles that work really well most of the time ? is it something anyone can learn ?   yes , and except in very rare cases , writing great blog post titles and other headlines can likely only be learned .   rather than relying on natural talent , people who know how to write headlines have learned to do three basic things :   1 . they understand that all compelling headlines make an intriguing promise that makes it almost irresistible to its target audience . understanding the intended audience is key — a really great headline generally wo n’t appeal to everyone , and watering it down for mass appeal will only hurt you .   2 . they study headlines that have been proven to work , and that usually means direct response advertising headlines . in that context , “ proven to work ” means people responded to that particular headline by pulling out their wallets and making a purchase . you can also learn to write better headlines by studying some of the top magazine editors , and even the tabloids you see at the supermarket checkout lane .   3 . most importantly , rather than simply mimicking great headlines , professional writers understand why the headline works . therefore they can make an educated decision as to which type of headline structure is most appropriate , and how to tweak it within a certain context .   so , what about this subheading of the post you ’re reading right now ?   1 . starting any heading with “ why ” at the beginning of a declarative statement ( instead of a question ) is one easy way to focus in on the benefit of reading your article . that ’s one of the reasons why this method works , but the words that follow the “ why ” are what ’s most important .   you can do the same by starting with “ here ’s why , ” “ what , ” “ when , ” or “ how . ” or you can simply make a strong statement that clearly demonstrates that the elaborated answer will be provided in the body content . and of course a carefully worded question can magnetically draw in your intended readers as well .   2 . this subheading is modeled after this famous advertising headline :   why some people almost always make money in the stock market   within the context of what i wanted to convey with this section , the basic structure of this classic headline works perfectly . why ?   3 . credibility . the use of the word “ some , ” and having “ almost ” modify “ always , ” make the headline much more plausible . not even the highest paid copywriters in the world always nail a headline that works . and some people never write great post titles , because they do n’t take the time to learn how .   many people feel that a great headline is bombastic and full of hyperbole , but that ’s usually not the case . if people do n’t believe you can deliver on your promise , they wo n’t bother reading further , and your over - the - top headline fails .   you ’ll gain an advantage over your competition by becoming a true student of great headline writing .   understanding what type of headline is appropriate to a specific context is the real key to learning how to write headlines and subheadings that get your content embraced and shared .',\n",
              " 'find your copy with amazon review mining ( updated december 2020 ) . qs to ask yourself before review mining   who is my target audience ? what solutions do they want from us ? what solutions are they using today ? where are those solutions found ?   you should n’t write copy .   you should n’t look inside your head for the messages that will convince your prospects .   you ’re not your prospect . so how the hell could you know what they need to hear ? it ’s vanity to think you could .   instead of writing your message , steal it . steal it directly from your prospects . ( tweet this )   i ’ve given that piece of copywriting advice about a million times – including here , here and here – but never explicitly on this ‘ ere copyhackers blog , strangely . and as a result , if you ’ve heard that “ amazon review mining ” or “ tripadvisor review mining ” is something you should do to find your message and write better copy , you ’re probably missing out on this teensy little point : how to do it .   how do you find your message   ( and stickier copy ) in the user reviews on   amazon , tripadvisor and other sites ?   first , here ’s the idea .   if your message does n’t come from you but rather from your prospect , then it holds that you should listen very closely to what your prospect says when she ’s discussing products and services that either a ) are yours or b ) are similar to yours . their words become yours . you ’ll take what they say , and mirror it back to them   there are many ways to listen to your prospects . most of them favor businesses with existing customers , a decent number of site visitors , or a solid and engaged email list . for example :   if you have customers you can connect with , you can interview them , record the convo , transcribe it , and scour that transcription for juicy tidbits . groove did this recently   , you can interview them , record the convo , transcribe it , and scour that transcription for juicy tidbits . groove did this recently if you have visitors to your site , you can do on - site interviews and mine their open - ended responses for gold .   , you can do on - site interviews and mine their open - ended responses for gold . if you know exactly where your prospects hang out , you can go there , sit quietly and pretend to play with your phone as you secretly record their convos … then transcribe , scour , etc .   , you can go there , sit quietly and pretend to play with your phone as you secretly record their convos … then transcribe , scour , etc . if you have an engaged email list that ’s not uber - tiny , you can email a survey to them and mine their open - ended responses , again , for gold .   but what if you have zilch - o in the customer department ?   or what if – more likely – you ’re totally terrified to get on the phone with a customer and interview them ?   that ’s where review mining is a godsend . because products and services like yours already exist , it ’s likely that people who have purchased and/or used those products and services have shared their opinions about them somewhere online . you can read through those reviews . learn what people love , hate , are worried about . learn what their expectations and motivations are for solutions like yours . and even find really sticky messages .   you like examples ? how ’s this for an example   if you ’ve seen me speak , you ’ve seen me on mixergy or you ’ve read my ebooks , you might recognize this example .   i was working with a rehab center called beachway , and i was struggling to find test - worthy messages because it was very , very difficult to interview past or existing customers and to survey them . this was largely because the subject matter was so emotional , coating the things i wanted to know – the drivers that pushed them to rehab , their fears about rehab – in either a lot of sugar or a lot of vinegar . it was hard to get true insights … so i turned to amazon .   i looked up the following 6 books on amazon :   it was n’t the books themselves i was interested in . it was both the subject matter and , most importantly , the reviews actual readers had left .   for maybe 2 or 3 hours , i read through more than 500 reviews . i copied the actual language that book reviewers were using in their reviews , and i pasted their words – with as few ‘ summaries ’ or abstractions as possible – into 1 of 3 tables , exactly like so :   ( here ’s an editable version of that table – save a copy for yourself as you can not edit this public one )   after i ’d mined those reviews , i read through them … and one direct quote from a reviewer stood out more than the others . it became the following headline :   we tested that headline against the control , which was “ your addiction ends here ” . the new headline – the one i found in amazon reviews – brought in > 400 % more clicks on the orange button … and > 20 % more lead - gen form submits on the next page . to be clear , that means the headline on the home page impacted sign - ups on the next page . that ’s a powerful headline . and no other treatment has managed to beat , “ if you think you need rehab , you do . ”   you wo n’t just find copy in user reviews –   you ’ll find the messages you need to put on the page   when i was writing the google play description for the latest version of flow recently , i went through the user reviews of the flow app as well as the reviews of competing apps – like asana , in particular .   what i found became a guide for my rewrite of the description . i found myself asking metalab ’s android developer qs like these before i wrote a word :   is it a native app ? ( everyone seems to want this . )   does it work offline ? ( asana reviews show great disappointment that it does n’t work offline . one said he ’d like to see an “ offline version that could store new tasks till i connect to the internet ” . )   is it fast ? ( asana ’s negative reviews have a lot to do with how slow it is . you may have an idea , but by the time the app loads and updates , the idea is gone . )   does it allow subtasks ? ( asana does n’t seem to , and several people have said how important that is . )   does it have “ widgets ” ? ( an asana reviewer said this : “ this app has no widgets , meaning that it completely disregards what may be android ’s single most effective feature for keeping task information at the user ’s fingertips and making adding and managing tasks a seamless practice . ” )   when you go through user reviews one by one , what ’s really important to your prospects rises to the top . you see recurring questions , recurring statements . you hear their frustrations , and you can feel their excitement . this all makes its way into your copy and messaging hierarchy – the things you need to say , and the order in which your visitors need to read them . naturally , this exercise reveals not only pure gold for copywriting , but also for product development .   sounds good – but is amazon review mining   as easy as it looks ?   before you even start digging through amazon , tripadvisor , itunes , angieslist , yelp , youtube comments , imdb or healthgrades – among a million other review sites – you ’re probably going to run into a question i get a lot : “ what product should i look for ? ”   “ we ’re trying to get small businesses to choose our law practice . what books should i read ? ”   “ we ’re trying to sell bookbags to moms . there are no books about bookbags , and the reviews for bookbags do n’t reveal much . ”   “ we ’re trying to sell trips to africa , but there are n’t any reviews on tripadvisor for non - safaris in africa . ”   deciding what books – or products – to read the reviews for is usually the hardest part . and it can get frustrating . so let me clarify . you are not trying to find reviews for products exactly like yours . if you can , great , but that ’s super - rare . what you ’re trying to do is figure out how your prospects feel , what they think , and what they love , hate , worry about , etc . which means …   it ’s about your prospects .   it ’s about the outcome they ’re seeking .   it ’s not about your product . so it ’s not about a book . or a trip . or a contractor . or an app .   people first . that should not surprise you . after all , if we say anything on repeat around here , it ’s this : it ’s not about you , it ’s about your prospects . that mindset will carry you successfully through any and every copywriting challenge you ever face .   so before you head to angieslist to see how to sell a hammer , ask yourself these questions , in this order , to reveal the reviews you should go in search of , and where to look :   who is my target audience ? what solutions do i believe they want from us ? what are their goals ? what solutions might they be using today to achieve those goals ? if those solutions are online , where are they ?   to illustrate how this works , let ’s look at the beachway example again .   who is my target audience ?   addicts and their families . what solutions do i believe they want from us ?   to stop the cycle of addiction and get their lives back . to end the pain permanently . to do so quickly and with as little embarrassment as possible . what solutions might they be using today to achieve those goals ?   reading books about addiction . going to aa meetings . talking to their pastor . praying . if those solutions are online , where are they ?   books = amazon reviews . aa meetings = aagrapevine.com .   so i ’d go to amazon and aagrapevine , and there i would pore over what my prospects are writing there and fill this up .   let ’s try it again – but this time for something hard , like selling a saas solution for hr . i totally randomly thought this up , googled it , and found this site : https://www.workday.com/. so let ’s pretend we ’re going to try to find test - worthy messages and stickier copy for workday . we ’ll have to make some assumptions here ‘ cos i ’m not sure who their target audience is , but let ’s give it a shot nonetheless .   who is my target audience ?   hr departments in relatively large organizations ( e.g. , > 50 ppl ) what solutions do i believe they want from us ?   to lower costs in their org while keeping the best team - members happily employed . what solutions might they be using today to achieve those goals ?   reading books about lowering costs in companies . reading books about employee engagement . reading blog posts . checking out glassdoor.com . visiting forums . attending conferences . taking advanced degrees . if those solutions are online , where are they ?   books = amazon reviews . comments on https://hrinnercircle.com/ and other blogs . glassdoor . forums . conferences = this one . degrees = certificate , classes , more .   lots of places to go looking for your messages , right ? watch the following video to see a shortened version of how i ’d start analyzing amazon reviews :   what do you think ?   you prepared to go boldly and confidently swipe messages from your prospects … without anyone being the wiser ?

  10 a.m. : while late - morning send times were the most popular in general , several concluded that the best time to send emails is at 10 a.m. another notable time is 11 a.m. 8 p.m.-midnight : i bet you did n\\'t expect that one . it looks like emails generally receive more opens and clicks later in the evening . as campaign monitor notes , this is likely due to people checking their email before going to bed . 2 p.m. : it looks like you might be successful by sending your emails later in the day as people are checking out of work mode or looking for distractions . 6 a.m. : i guess this makes sense since 50 % of you begin your day by emailing in bed . before you even stand up , you \\'re opening emails . good morning . while many of the studies found varying results , here is how you can prioritize your send times based on data :   note : a lot of these articles mentioned time zones . the big takeaway is to choose the time zone for the majority of your audience . if you \\'re in the u.s. , that \\'s likely eastern time since that time zone covers a lot of these articles mentioned time zones . the big takeaway is to choose the time zone for the majority of your audience . if you \\'re in the u.s. , that \\'s likely eastern time since that time zone covers 50 % of the population . if you \\'re a local company , send at these times in your own time zone .   3 . the controversy behind what you just read   that \\'s the advice . now ignore it .   but keep in mind , the primary driver of engagement for your list is you : your content , your industry , the list you ’ve uploaded .   4 . turn \\' it depends \\' into a real answer based on your audience   send emails at the best times as you just learned from this post . analyze the data from your tests to see when you received the most traffic .   plan to test the best days and times with your audience   tuesday at 10 a.m. thursday at 8 p.m. wednesday at 2 p.m. tuesday at 6 a.m. thursday at 10 a.m. wednesday at 8 p.m. tuesday at 2 p.m. thursday at 6 a.m. wednesday at 10 a.m. tuesday at 8 p.m. thursday at 2 p.m. wednesday 6 a.m.   measure your email test \\'s success   first , grab this free google analytics custom report to understand your best days to send email available in your kit that complements this blog post )   another trap is to think of \" best day \" and \" best time of day \" as two separate issues . the best time to send depends on the day you send it . and vice versa .   but let \\'s say you just want to know the general best time to send email by hour — without the day . grab this second google analytics custom report to measure your best time by hour only available in your kit that complements this blog post ) .   5 . how to get more opens from your email subject lines   you probably found this post after looking through several others searching for a real answer to the question , \" when is the best time to send email ?

furthermore , there may be differences between different businesses with different audiences . here \\'s a comparison chart of four different verticals from sendinblue : image source still , it does make sense to use these days and times to start a test for your own audience . as john from mailchimp notes both megan and john are right , though . and that \\'s why you can use your own data and google analytics to help you send email more effectively . there are two phases to understand the best times to send email to your audience : it \\'s really simple if you plan your work , then work your plan . follow this outline to test your days and times to send email . regardless of how many emails you send during a week , you can walk through this process from first email to last email over the time frame that works best for you . it \\'s like a checklist for the days and times you \\'ll send your next 12 emails : that is now your plan for the next 12 emails you \\'ll send to your subscribers . keep in mind , research also shows that 23 % of your subscribers will open emails within 60 minutes after you send them . so it \\'s fine toto the peak time . what you \\'re really after is understanding how much traffic your emails are contributing to your blog . after all , these are your most loyal readers who read , share , and bring additional traffic to your site . so while you could go into your email service provider \\'s dashboard to look at your open and clickthrough rates , an easier way to gauge the performance of your test is by using google analytics and reviewing your referral traffic from email . when you first open this report , you \\'ll simply set the start date and end date to the times when you ran the test . then selectonce you click through to filter your data to show only referral traffic from email , you \\'ll see the best days that are giving you the most traffic listed in order according to page views . from there , you can click through again to see the best times by hour when you receive that traffic . this is probably the best place to start with your research . something that has stuck with me from this analysis was a comment from mark brownlow all the way back from 2009 : that seems like good advice . just like the first report , enter in the date range when you did your email test , then filter to see only referral traffic fromfrom there , you \\'ll see your best times to send email based on data from your own audience . it \\'s that easy to set up your email test . but you want even more traffic than you \\'re already getting ... so a good next step would be to get more opens . and the best way to improve that is by writing even better email subject lines . it \\'s no secret that one of the primary drivers of opens is your email subject line . it \\'s the part that usually stands out the most in your subscribers \\' inboxes right from the get - go , making your first impression for the content you \\'re sending .   so if opens lead to clickthroughs , and opens come from awesome email subject lines , let \\'s explore a few data - driven ways to write those subject lines so they help you reach your goal to get more traffic .   use your headlines for inspiration   examples : how to make { subject } that will { benefit }   21 + ways to grow your { subject }   do you think you can { benefit } ?   your subscribers want to know what \\'s in it for them   examples : 5 reasons why you should { subject }   { benefit } while you sleep   [ template ] 10 best { subject }   show who they could be like after they open your email   examples : how { name / company } does { subject }   { name / company } can afford any { subject } , he uses { solution }   how { name / company } got { number / desirable outcome } in { number of days }   make it unique to stand out in a cluttered inbox   examples : real { audience } use { solution }   discover the { solution }   { subject } , { subject } , and { unrelated subject } ?

judging from the data , answering that question in your email subject line is an awesome way to increase your open rate . you could call this a benefit , appealing to self - interest , or sharing your value proposition . the point is this : make it clear what your audience will get if they just open your email to experience something they really desire . social proof helps your subscribers see themselves being successful — which works especially well when they see others rocking your solution . so use your email subject line to appeal to the benefits of stories , case studies , examples , and testimonials scattered throughout your blog post . a lot of successful email subject line examples suggest that uniqueness gets opens . think of including jokes , humor , or something unexpected in your subject line — anything that arouses curiosity beyond the same - old , same - old . the fear of missing out is a powerful motivator because it gets your subscribers thinking , \" what do they know that i do n\\'t ? \" showing a deadline , appealing to a sense of urgency , or even suggesting scarcity in your email subject line can help you increase your opens . it \\'s true that blog posts that feel fresh or essentially reporting on the news in your niche get some of the most social shares of any type of content . in fact , news posts get the most social shares of any type of content ( yes , seriously ) . when you write content that appeals to recent events in your industry , use those facts , subjects , and teasers in your email subject lines to spread the word quickly . there is an old - school rule that email subject lines should be about 50 characters long . since 54 % of emails are opened on mobile devices , that seems like it \\'s still a pretty good idea : the shorter your email subject line , the better . hubspot calls it the \" e.e . cummings subject line \" and it \\'s something copywriting master joanna wiebe of copyhackers does consistently : write your email subject line in all lowercase . joanna says this approach is more like how a friend or family member would email you , and she offers this advice for email subject line writing : follow that exercise for every subject line you write , and you \\'ll get the opens you \\'re shooting for . nearly every email service provider lets you send a / b tests for your subject lines . you can do this same exercise for your own subject lines to help you understand why your audience opens and improve all of your future subject lines . simply write down your winner and loser from the test , the difference in the results , and scrutinize the reason why your winner performed the best : you can see from these examples that we \\'ve been trying to strongly appeal to the benefits behind opening the email . nearly all of these subject lines reuse the blog titles to test for the best - performing headlines . there is still room for improvement!this free tool analyzes email subject lines and offers suggestions on how they can be improved . try it here once you get that email open , how can you get the most click - throughs from your subscribers to read your blog post ? it \\'s a good question that deserves a simple and data - driven answer . while your email subject line is one of the primary ways to get email opens , the design of your email can also impact your success . you might think that a designed email — or html - enhanced with a theme of some kind — would increase your opens and clickthroughs . but when hubspot researched the idea of html versus plain text emails , they found that html emails actually decreased both their open and clickthrough rates . they summarized their findings with a very bold statement : super surprising , right?but hubspot was n\\'t the only one to come to that conclusion . diythemes also testing a plain text version of their e - newsletter which their subscribers absolutely loved .   and when we at coschedule tested several html - enhanced emails for the ones we use to announce new blog posts , we found that our plain text versions increased the amount of opens by 3.5 % while decreasing our clickthroughs by 2.12 % .   at first , you might think that data is a bit misleading , but thatto read our content , despite the slight percentage drop in clickthroughs . so why is that ? to bring up joanna wiebe \\'s awesome point from writing subject lines , it \\'s because plain text emails look more authentic and less spammy than html - enhanced emails . hubspot came to the same conclusion in their research , hinting that email filters may be strong enough to weed out over - enhanced emails .   if joanna and hubspot are right on those assumptions , then data backs it up . more of your subscribers see email as a 1 - to-1 communication tool that plain text messages seem to reflect while html - enhanced emails scream mass marketing .   takeaway : send plain text emails rather than html - enhanced emails .   keep it informal   takeaway : write to your subscribers as if you were talking to your best friend . opt for you instead of one , forget yourself and focus entirely on your audience , and use contractions because that \\'s probably just how you talk anyway .   share the reasons why your subscribers should click through   there are a few ways to do this : appeal to your subscribers \\' biggest challenges : people avoid confronting their challenges because they \\'re hard to deal with . address the problem with an immediate solution ( * ah hem * reading your post is the solution ) to get more clickthroughs . know how they measure success : your subscribers have goals . when you share \" how to do { subject } to { reach the goal } \" you \\'ll immediately hook your subscribers . use their own words to tell them what they wanna hear : joanna wiebe from copyhackers suggests that using the words your audience uses to define their problems and goals helps increase conversions . when we took that advice in building a landing page , we experienced a conversion rate of 27 % . yeah , that works .   survey : this is hands down the # 1 best way to understand your audience \\'s goals , challenges , and the words they use to describe them . use a free survey tool like polldaddy to send your existing email subscribers a survey with this one question : what is your biggest challenge as a { insert their role } ? blog comments : monitor blog post comments to find common problems . you can continue the conversation by probing with more questions to find out why those things are problems and what they \\'re looking for as a solution . social media : listen to your followers when they participate in facebook groups , twitter chats , and linkedin groups . spark up a conversation to dig deeper when necessary .   when you read this post ...   you \\'ll learn ...   you will discover ...   when you read this post , you \\'ll grow your traffic by getting more email opens and more clickthroughs to your awesome content .   by getting more email opens and more clickthroughs to your awesome content . when you read this post , you \\'ll discover the best times and days to send your emails to grow your traffic .   . when you read this post , you \\'ll also learn how to write better subject lines and messages that will get more clickthroughs .   and a final email writing tip : keep \\'em short . some of our highest clickthrough rates come from emails that are three sentences long .   now you know how to get more traffic from email   send your emails on tuesdays . send them at 10 a.m. test the best days and times to find out when your audience is most active . write compelling email subject lines that stand out . use plain text emails and write messages that assume your subscribers have already clicked through to read your blog post .   another reason html - enhanced emails may perform slightly worse than plain text emails could be due to the fact that the message in the email itself often begins with gibberish . let me explain . this is what html - enhanced emails look like before you open them : and this is what informal plain text emails look like before you open them : no one wants to feel like you \\'re marketing to them , but rather , that they \\'ve opted in to receiving information that will help them . email is a way for you to build trust with the audience that is the most likely to convert into real customers . so , how can you build that trust ? just write like you would to a friend . it \\'s just fine to start an email with hey there . let people into your lives a bit like this example of many from noah kagan : now , i \\'m not saying you have to be super whimsical like noah , but i know that he \\'s built lists that have added up to seven figures of email subscribers ( yes , that means more than a million subscribers ) . so how does he retain those email subscribers ? by treating email as an avenue for a relationship . you read his emails and feel like you know the guy even if you \\'ve never met him . focus your message on explaining the value your subscribers will get when they visit your blog post . now , the value is n\\'t the same as what your post covers , but answers the question , what \\'s in it for me?now , if you do n\\'t know those things , chances are ... you probably do n\\'t know your audience very well and that may reflect in your content . here are three simple ways to get the information you need to write more effective emails : another email writing tip involves a bit of simple psychology : write your email in a way that helps your subscribers feel liketo click through to read your blog post . what does that mean ? it means using proven phrases like these ...... because those phrases assume the subscriber will act on the advice you provide or they will feel the cognitive dissonance of knowing they should have done something but they chose not to . that technique leads directly into a call to action your subscribers can envision themselves doing . for example , here \\'s what that could look like for this post specifically : you see how each of those examples suggests that you will do the action , and that when you do , you \\'ll solve a problem and get the benefits . you just learned a ton of information that will help you get more traffic from email marketing . here \\'s a recap of the process : where will you start ?

” question that every reader wants to know . source coschedule is notorious for offering amazing , free templates in every blog on their page . since offers like this can be few and far between , it ’s helpful to the reader that the headline mentions the free email marketing templates perk right from the get - go . take note that coschedule uses one of the suggested emotion words ( i.e. free ) , and tells readers exactly what they can achieve with these free templates ( i.e. execute everything).by utilizing writing in which you clearly lay out the benefits of your content to the reader , you ’re more than likely to encourage an increase of click - throughs and social shares for your content simply because of that emotional connection and trust you ’re creating with your audience . source with everything being online nowadays , mariah coz knows everyone is looking for ways to make this process easier and headache - free . by creating a headline that highlights the simplicity behind her method of creating online course content , she ’s sure to attract countless people who have a difficult time with transitioning from in - person to online materials . : it ’s also a good idea to use words that possess some kind of positive tone in your headlines because people want to get a worthwhile , pleasant , and simple experience out of whatever they can . reassuring readers that your content will provide a stress - free , rewarding experience is the perfect method for encouraging their engagement . let ’s catch a glimpse at some examples of real articles that use emotional headlines to snatch the attention of readers using powerful language . source based on what you know about emotional headlines so far , what is it about this headline that might label it as emotional ? well , for starters , we see the word “ secretly ” , which is a curiosity - inducing word , like we mentioned previously . not only that , but readers ( particularly iphone users ) are discovering that this directly relates to them and their privacy . as an apple iphone user , i ’d be concerned , too . no one wants their personal information to be disclosed to people they do n’t know , especially if it ’s being done without their knowledge ; that ’s just … creepy . source what appeals to readers about this headline ? this is a great example of a headline that utilizes the curiosity gap — a writing method that shows point a and point c , but fails to explain how we got from one point to another . in this case , readers are left wondering : “ how did oral roberts shock ohio state ? ” or “ what was the first big upset of the ncaa ? ” this can be especially intriguing to people who are big basketball fans because people want to be in the know on what they ’re passionate about . not to mention that this article was posted during march madness , the biggest tournament of the year for ncaa basketball . source remember in those movies where a fight would erupt in the high school hallway , and everyone would gather around in a circle to take videos and photos and chant “ fight ! fight ! fight ! ” ? well , here ’s a real - life example of something similar . this article is taking advantage of the idea that people are mesmerized by other individuals fighting ; but , in this case , the people fighting are involved with two major league baseball teams . we want to know what started the fight and who came out victorious , and the ringer is capitalizing on that psychology in their article . source not everyone will have the amazing opportunity to see a live volcano in their lifetime ; it ’s something most people will only see in documentaries , cgi movies , or animation films . the verge takes advantage of the beauty we see as an erupting volcano by providing a one - of - a - kind visual . not only that , but the fact that a drone can fly over the action to get an aerial view makes it even more exhilarating . source while this blog post is catering to just marketers , it caters to the idea that marketing is a complex industry , and a marketer needs to have a lot of versatility when it comes to performing their job effectively . by using words like “ essential ” and “ successful ” , coschedule is telling their readers that they have all of the information marketers need to reach their goals . not only that , but incorporating the current year makes it relevant and up - to - date . source in this day and age , who is n’t stressed ? evernote uses this headline to empathize with their readers and lend a helping hand to those in need . catering to the idea that people want to relieve their stress as easily as possible , and using a word like “ powerful ” in their headline , is sure to appeal to millions of readers who just want some relief . source let ’s be real for a second here ; who does n’t like animals ? not just any animals , but funny dogs ? heartless people , that ’s who . the combination of a pun in the headline coupled with something cute and cuddly is sure to warm the hearts of people who want a good chuckle . highlighting the humorous personality of a dog with past trauma was definitely a win for the japan times . source did you know that there are 600 million blogs across the internet out of 1.7 billion websites ? just to put that into perspective , that ’s approximately a quarter of the content people can discover on the entire web . even if someone does n’t have a blog of their own , they more than likely read blogs on a consistent basis . blogs are relevant , useful , and informative , making this article topic consistent with information that bloggers want to know . companies and individuals who are blogging or want to blog want an idea of what an appropriate amount of blogging means , and this article provides that answer . the title alone informs readers that they should definitely avoid blogging on the daily , if you want to avoid feeling miserable . source there are a lot of components to this headline that make it an emotional read , but , in short , it appeals to the same idea that our funny dog article used for their headline . this headline also takes readers by surprise by indicating that a powerful predator like a cheetah needs an esa . does n’t that just make you wanna cry from the adorableness ? source our final emotional headline example comes from tom ’s guide , which ( like many of our other examples ) takes advantage of appealing to a popular interest . tv shows are all the rage , and roku knows it ; so they decided to add another tv show that is a must - watch , and it ’s free ! there ’s one of our emotional words that we talked about before . who does n’t like free stuff?an awesome resource you can use to craft emotional headlines ( for free ) is coschedule ’s headline analyzer studio . whether you want to measure your headline ’s potential performance , get advice on a new headline , or browse word banks dedicated to emotion and power words by upgrading to headline studio pro , your content will benefit from coschedule ’s extensive headline research that has all been implemented into one , impressive feature . when you ’re working on writing the best emotional headline , be sure you ’re referring to the word balance section — where you can focus your attention on your common , uncommon , emotional , and power words . a neat feature you can find in this tool is categorized word banks that contain vocabulary dedicated to words that can benefit your headline . play around with the headline analyzer studio and see what cool stuff you can find out about your headline crafting skills . it ’s a lot to take in , but your content and your audience thank you for it . feel free to take advantage of the examples that have been laid out here for you , scurry on over to the headline analyzer studio , and keep researching ways to make your headline even more emotional . the best part is that you do n’t have to stick to the resources in this post ; keep conducting research and experimenting with your titles and content , so you can reach the most people , the right way . coschedule ’s blog is a fruitful place to find all the answers you need for your marketing needs , and it has all been backed up by impressive research from people who eat , sleep , and breathe marketing . best of luck ! this post was originally published on july 22 , 2014 . it was most recently updated and republished on june 21 , 2021 . garrett moon and peyton muldoon contributed to writing this post .',\n",

  how are others telling the story ?   what styles are you drawn to ?   what infographics do your readers enjoy ?   why was it successful ?   how can it be improved visually ?   pro tip : do n\\'t undervalue the value in asking these questions . they very well may save you hours once you start designing your infographic .   4 . design your infographic   option 1 : outsource it   contest outsourcing : companies like 99designs allow you to create a contest centered around your design needs . in this case , you choose your dollar amount , enter the design details of your infographic , and then wait to see what designers submit in hopes of finding the best one for you . several concepts are submitted , so there ’s typically a good amount to choose from , and it \\'s always quite fast .   companies like 99designs allow you to create a contest centered around your design needs . in this case , you choose your dollar amount , enter the design details of your infographic , and then wait to see what designers submit in hopes of finding the best one for you . several concepts are submitted , so there ’s typically a good amount to choose from , and it \\'s always quite fast . freelance outsourcing : another option is to find a freelance designer through sites like dribbble or behance . this will give you direct access to the designer so a relationship can be built . you \\'ll also have the space for any revisions that might need to take place . freelancers either get paid hourly or project by project , and so it \\'s important to ask that right away when selecting your designer .   option 2 : create it yourself   free tools : there are several amazing infographic tools out there that let you easily start the design process . visage , vizualize , easel.ly , piktochart , infogram , visual.ly , venngage , visme.co , and canva just to name a few . there ’s also several video tutorials if you have a specific program you ’d like to work in .   there are several amazing infographic tools out there that let you easily start the design process . visage , vizualize , easel.ly , piktochart , infogram , visual.ly , venngage , visme.co , and canva just to name a few . there ’s also several video tutorials if you have a specific program you ’d like to work in . choose a color scheme : ask yourself what mood will show off your topic best , and then find some different color palettes that display the same mood . i love using adobe kuler for this . you can easily take visual inspiration and play around with the different colors to find something that fits exactly what you ’re going for . typically , there are three main colors throughout , and then two accent colors , making a five color scheme ideal for both vibrancy and consistency in your infographic .   ask yourself what mood will show off your topic best , and then find some different color palettes that display the same mood . i love using adobe kuler for this . you can easily take visual inspiration and play around with the different colors to find something that fits exactly what you ’re going for . typically , there are three main colors throughout , and then two accent colors , making a five color scheme ideal for both vibrancy and consistency in your infographic . select key points to highlight : just as in a story , there are certain pieces of information that are more important than others . with design , it \\'s the same way ; they call this visual hierarchy . to utilize hierarchy in infographics , i try to find the three core subtopics and then distinguish each section slightly differently throughout the infographic . once i have three key sections , i begin by adding the smaller details . what is each section ’s title ? what data belongs in each section ? what captions can be added to explain the data ? start big and work your way down to the smaller elements .   5 . review for consistency   is anything standing out too much ?   is there any information that ’s not obvious enough ?   does the story flow smoothly from beginning to end ?   pro tip : print out your infographic at full size and stand 10 feet away from it . what do you see ?

\\' and ‘ why ? \\' we should know exactly what the goal of each project is , and exactly why it ’s important . if you skip these two questions , two outcomes are bound to happen . either you \\'ll start working and get lost somewhere in the middle of the project , or you ’ll create something awesome that has no purpose , which is quite sad . personally , i ’d rather make something awesome and have it reach a goal . then it \\'s a win - win for everyone ! in order to do that , every great infographic must begin with a good topic for example , at coschedule , we noticed that everyone was asking , \" what \\'s the best time to post on social media ? \" and so we turned that very question into a blog post and then an infographic . use the three questions above to help you narrow in on a topic that will engage your audience and guide you through the creation process . want to know how to make an infographic from a post you \\'ve already written ? skip to step # 3now that you have a stellar topic , it ’s time to do research . this step might take some time , but it ’s absolutely critical so embrace it and dig in . find absolutely everything you can around that concept by beginning with the large resources , and then move onto the small bits and pieces that may be hiding . again , do n\\'t be scared to invest significant time into this stage . research is the very core of an infographic , so it \\'s worth it in the long run . search for similar counterparts and find out why your topic is essential to what you ’re trying to prove . then , explore the ideas that completely oppose it . this will give you a wholesome perspective , and might even surprise or counter your initial idea . let the data shape your topic and adjust when necessary . remember , infographics are first and foremost research ; however , boring data designed nicely will still end up as a boring infographic . while it might seem tedious , take the time to find interesting data so you can set yourself up for one heck of an infographic . statistics and numbers do exceptionally well on infographics because they \\'re easy to digest , and they hold a ton of value . they ’re both fascinating and can be represented in a hundred different visual formats . it ’s a win - win for you and your audience!with all the research and numbers floating around , it \\'s easy for an infographic to lack a sense of story . bring it to life by thinking of the big picture , and choose a theme or metaphor that can be consistent throughout all the data . this way your infographic will read like a book from beginning to end , giving your audience a sense of excitement and curiosity as they read . just when you thought you were done with research .... say hello to visual inspiration!now that you have all your numbers and stats , its time to clear your head and gather visual ideas for your infographic . some of my favorite places to begin my search for visual inspiration can be found at behance pinterest , and dribbble . take a break , switch your perspective , and let \\'s talk visuals . remember , the purpose of getting visual inspiration is to prepare your brain for the creative aspects of your infographic , not to simply collect and copy everything you see . you , and only you , have an opportunity to create an infographic better than ever before , so take your ideas and run with them!you’ve come prepared with an awesome topic that your audience loves , you have data to back it up from credible sources , and your creativity is ready to explode from all the visual inspiration . now , it ’s time to design ! here are your options ... outsourcing can be a great option if you do n’t have design experience or the time to create an infographic . and good news ! there are several designers out there who are waiting to work with you . you \\'re probably wondering , how it works?you’re awesome ! way to take your infographic idea head on . whether you have design experience or are just beginning , here are some helpful tips to get you started : in both of these scenarios , it \\'s incredibly important to have a good design brief . a design brief is the ‘ what \\' and ‘ why \\' written out so your designer knows exactly what the goal of the infographic should accomplish . it should also include any other guidelines or specifications the design must follow . without clear guidelines , there will be miscommunication and then it \\'s easy for resources and time to be wasted . define your infographic , create some guidelines , and then choose carefully . find a designer you can trust . way to go , you \\'ve come so far ! once you have your infographic initially laid out and designed , take a step back and get some feedback . do n’t be afraid to ask your peers or friends for honest , constructive feedback so you can refine the design to perfection before hitting publish . there ’s always something to be modified after the feedback stage , and it always makes the end result better . this is your final step . your infographic is beautiful and filled with awesome data , so now it \\'s time to add that very essential call to action that will guide readers into doing what they should do next . should they sign up for something ?

              " 'aspect ratio boxes | css - tricks . i had a little situation the other day where i needed to make one of those aspect - ratio friendly boxes . this is n’t particularly new stuff . i think the original credit goes as far back as 2009 and thierry koblentz ’s intrinsic ratios and maintained popularity even for other kinds of content with articles like uncle dave ’s ol’ padded box .   let ’s go on a little journey through this concept , as there is plenty to talk about .   the core concept : padding in percentages is based on width   even when that is a little unintuitive , like for vertical padding . this is n’t a hack , but it is weird : padding - top and padding - bottom is based on the parent element ’s width . so if you had an element that is 500px wide , and padding - top of 100 % , the padding - top would be 500px .   is n’t that a perfect square , 500px × 500px ? yes , it is ! an aspect ratio !   if we force the height of the element to zero ( height : 0 ; ) and do n’t have any borders . then padding will be the only part of the box model affecting the height , and we ’ll have our square .   now imagine instead of 100 % top padding , we used 56.25 % . that happens to be a perfect 16:9 ratio ! ( 9 / 16 = 0.5625 ) .   now we have a friendly aspect ratio box , that works well in fluid width environments . if the width changes , so does the height , and the element keeps that aspect ratio .   use case : a background - image   perhaps we ’ve made a typographic lockup . it ’s for the title of an article , so it makes sense to use an < h1 > tag .   < h1 > happy birthday < /h1 >   we can make that < h1 > tag the aspect ratio box and apply the lockup as a background image .   h1 { overflow : hidden ; height : 0 ; padding - top : 56.25 % ; background : url(/images / happy - birthday.svg ) ; }   but i lied about that aspect ratio up there . it ’s not actually a 16:9 image . i just downloaded that graphic off a stock photography site . it happens to be an svg with a viewbox=\"0 0 1127.34 591.44 \" which means it ’s essentially an 1127.34 × 591.44 image in terms of aspect ratio . or it could have been a 328 × 791 image .   i ’d say it ’s very common for any random image not to fit into a very specific pre - defined aspect ratio …   the math of any possible aspect ratio   perfect squares and 16:9 stuff is great , but the values used for those are just simple math . an aspect ratio can be anything , and they commonly are completely arbitrary . a video or image can be cropped to any size .   so how do we figure out the padding - top for our 1127.34 × 591.44 svg above ?   one way is using calc ( ) , like this :   padding - top : calc(591.44 / 1127.34 * 100 % ) ;   it was expressed to me not long ago that using calc ( ) here may be “ slower ” , but i ’ve never seen any evidence of that . i imagine that yes , the computer does need to calculate something , so in a head - to - head battle against a situation where it does n’t , calculating is slower . but a math problem does n’t seem like too much work for a computer . for example , the popular intel pentium iii ( released in 1999 ) could do 2,054 mips or “ millions of instructions per second ” , so it would make imperceptively quick work of a division problem . and now chips are 50× faster .   if we were using a preprocessor like sass , we could do the calculation ahead of time :   padding - top : 591.44px / 1127.34px * 100 % ;   either way , i ’m a fan of leaving the math in the authored code .   how do you put content inside if padding is pushing everything down ?   we hid the content in the demo above , by letting the content get pushed out and hiding the overflow . but what if you need an aspect ratio box while keeping content inside of it ? that ’s slightly trickier . we ’ll need to position it back up into place . absolute positioning can be up for that job .   say we ’re just using text alone now , but still want the aspect ratio box . we ’ll need an inside wrapper for the absolute positioning . let ’s get specific with our classnames :   < h1 class=\"aspect - ratio - box \" > < div class=\"aspect - ratio - box - inside \" > happy birthday < /div > < /h1 >   then do the positioning :   .aspect - ratio - box { height : 0 ; overflow : hidden ; padding - top : 591.44px / 1127.34px * 100 % ; background : white ; position : relative ; } .aspect - ratio - box - inside { position : absolute ; top : 0 ; left : 0 ; width : 100 % ; height : 100 % ; }   just for fun , let ’s go full blast here and center that text and size it so it scales with the box :   < h1 class=\"aspect - ratio - box \" > < div class=\"aspect - ratio - box - inside \" > < div class=\"flexbox - centering \" > < div class=\"viewport - sizing \" > happy birthday < /div > < /div > < /div > < /h1 >   few more classes to style :   .flexbox - centering { height : 100 % ; display : flex ; justify - content : center ; align - items : center ; } .viewport - sizing { font - size : 5vw ; }   use case : video   this is probably the # 1 most common and practical use case for all this aspect ratio box stuff . html5 < video > is n’t an issue , as it behaves as if it has an aspect ratio just like < img > s do . but a lot of video on the web arrives in < iframe > s , which do not scale with an aspect ratio .   this is exactly what fitvids is all about . it finds videos on the page , figures out their unique aspect ratios , then applies these same css concepts to them to make them fluid width while maintaining their unique aspect ratios .   fitvids is jquery based , but there are vanilla javascript options , like this one by ross zurowski .   but … what if there is too much content ?   back to arbitrary ( probably textual ) content for a bit .   we ’re essentially setting heights here , which should always flash a blinking red light when working with css . the web likes to grow downward , and setting fixed heights is an enemy to that natural movement .   if the content becomes too much for the space , we ’re in bad design territory :   bad design territory   maybe we could do something like overflow : auto ; but that might be awkward design territory .   the pseudo element tactic   this is what has become , i think , the best way to handle an aspect ratio box that has completely arbitrary content in it . keith grant has a good writeup on it . marc hinse had an explanation and demos back in 2013 .   with this technique , you get the aspect ratio box with less markup , and it ’s still safe if the content exceeds the height .   the trick is to apply the % padding to a pseudo - element instead of the box itself . you float the pseudo - element , so the content inside can be inside nicely , then clear the float .   .aspect - ratio - box { background : white ; } .aspect - ratio - box::before { content : \" \" ; width : 1px ; margin - left : -1px ; float : left ; height : 0 ; padding - top : 591.44px / 1127.34px * 100 % ; } .aspect - ratio - box::after { / * to clear float * / content : \" \" ; display : table ; clear : both ; }   see how it ’s safer :   and a video :   using custom properties   this is perhaps the coolest idea of all !   thierry koblentz recently wrote this up ( removing link as thierry ’s site is dead . ) , crediting sérgio gomes for the idea .   to use it , you set a custom property scoped right to the element you need it on :   < div style=\"--aspect - ratio:815/419 ; \" > < /div > < div style=\"--aspect - ratio:16/9 ; \" > < /div > < ! -- even single value -- > < div style=\"--aspect - ratio:1.4 ; \" > < /div >   the css that styles this is gosh - danged genius :   [ style*=\"--aspect - ratio \" ] > : first - child { width : 100 % ; } [ style*=\"--aspect - ratio \" ] > img { height : auto ; } @supports ( --custom : property ) { [ style*=\"--aspect - ratio \" ] { position : relative ; } [ style*=\"--aspect - ratio\"]::before { content : \" \" ; display : block ; padding - bottom : calc(100 % / ( var(--aspect - ratio ) ) ) ; } [ style*=\"--aspect - ratio \" ] > : first - child { position : absolute ; top : 0 ; left : 0 ; height : 100 % ; }   allow me to quote thierry ’s step - by - step explanation :   we use [ style*=\"--aspect - ratio \" ] as a hook to target the appropriate boxes   as a hook to target the appropriate boxes we stretch the inner box regardless of support for custom property   we make sure the height of images comes from their intrinsic ratio rather than their height attribute   attribute we style the container as a containing block ( so the inner box references that ancestor for its positioning )   we create a pseudo - element to be used with the “ padding hack ” ( it is that element that creates the aspect ratio )   we use calc ( ) and var ( ) to calculate padding based on the value of the custom property   and to calculate padding based on the value of the custom property we style the inner box so it matches the dimensions of its containing block   lisi linhart tipped me off to ratio buddy , which is super cool :   notice that it uses a pseudo - element , but then still absolutely positions the inside container . that ’s kinda weird . you ’d probably either skip the pseudo - element and put the padding directly on the container , or float the pseudo - element so you do n’t need that inner container . still , i like the idea of a little generator for this .   tommy hodgins has cssplus which features aspecty which is just for this , assuming you ’re cool with a javascript parsing and changing your css kinda thing :   codepen embed fallback   i ’ve actually seen quite a bit of real world usage of aspect ratio boxes over the years . feel free to share if you ’ve had some experience !',\n",
              " 'the average web page ( data from analyzing 8 million websites ) | css - tricks . the following is a guest post by catalin rosu , who along with some colleagues , dug up a ton of data about the html content of web sites . this is the most recent study of its kind and wildly fascinating to see the results . i find it especially fun to compare the top results to what i would have guessed would have won .   we ’ve all been there . we try to improve our html code making it clean , beautiful , and readable . we do this in pursuit of better semantics and better accessibility , so that everyone can use it . it ’s our top priority . and we always have questions :   what is the best way to structure the markup ?   how are others doing it ?   questions like these were running through my mind . i wondered about how people write markup these days , as new web technologies emerge . so , i teamed up with a few of my colleagues at awrcloud and we came up with a data set of over 8 million pages from google top twenty results .   the studies that came before this one   back in 2005 , ian hickson , the editor of html5 specification , made an analysis of a sample of slightly over a billion documents , looking to see what the web is made of . a billion is an enormous number , but to google , nothing is impossible . with this huge amount of documents , he extracted valuable information about popular class names , elements , attributes , and related metadata . the outstanding results were later published as web authoring statistics , which is still the most powerful web authoring study ever made .   more recently , in 2008 , the opera metadata analysis and mining application crawler , mama , ended up analyzing about 3.5 million urls . brian wilson , the author of this impressive work , expanded the study by publishing results detailing page structures , including html , css , and javascript .   one of the analyses from web authoring statistics that later proved vital for the work in progress html5 development , was a list of the most popular class names in those html documents . the opera mama crawler also searched for the most common class names and in addition to google ’s results and they ’ve published relevant results on the popular id attribute values given to elements as well .   what does this study add to the conversation ?   the data for this study comes from 8,021,323 index pages gathered from the top twenty google results for about 30 million keywords , chosen by keyword volume . meaning : we had 30 million keywords . we ran a google search for each of them and took the urls for the top 20 results and added them to the list and removed the duplicates .   we can only assume that the relevance of these web pages to the general web population is very high . that is based on the likelihood these are popular and high - trafficked websites commensurate to their search result positions .   how fresh is this data ?   the latest data set is from may 20th , 2016 .   this new study will never surpass the former study google made back in 2005 . it ’s not about overcoming opera ’s great study either . it ’s about finding new and relevant insights on the actual markup used by the most popular and successful web pages on the internet .   so , how does the average html page look like nowadays ? take a look at the screenshots below and check out the study for the full statistics .   the stats   following our study , we find that the average website index page uses twenty six different different element types .   most website use 26 different html elements , give or take a few , with a curious peak at 9 .   the twenty six elements used on the most pages , ordered by frequency :   unsurprisingly , < head > and < html > are used on all sites . slightly surprising with < body > at 99 % – perhaps a very large website with a weird mistake ? the table elements at the bottom of the list are still on a surprising nearly - third of all websites .   among the document type declarations that specify which version of ( x)html a page is using , the latest html5 doctype is clearly leading the way .   nearly two thirds of all websites declare themselves at html5 .   if we look at all the elements that are specifically about telling browser or search engines about the site and how to style it , we found about 175 million elements , and here ’s how they broke down :   the breakdown of the 105 million elements for content sectioning looks like this :   < h3 > s are the most popular heading elements and overall content sectioning element .   of the billion text content elements :   the < div > has a commanding lead .   what ’s the future of web ?   us web developers and web content creators are curious and interested in usage , statistics , and browser support . these are the things that led to the class names findings back in 2005 , names known today as the most popular html5 tags .   the web is evolving fast . this is n’t new , but it can feel overwhelming . the trends are changing from year to year and as a web content creator , it requires motivation and effort to stay up to date . think about how the markup and the average web page looked like ten years ago and how a modern web page looks like today .   we also used the study to look at emerging technologies like web components . while web components allows authors to create arbitrarily named elements , we can look for standards elements used in the creation of web components .   nobody can predict the future . we can only guess how the average web page will look like ten years from now on . next time we run this study ( we ’re considering quarterly ) , will we see things like web components rise ?   and again , the complete data set is here .',\n",
              " 'random interesting facts on html / svg usage | css - tricks . last time , we saw how the average web page looks like using data from about 8 million websites . that ’s a lot of data , and we ’ve been continuing to sift through it . we ’re back again this time to showcase some random and hopefully interesting facts on markup usage .   hiding dom elements   there are various ways of hiding dom elements : completely , semantically , or visually .   considering the current practices and recommendations , check out the findings on the most used methods to hide things via html or css :   selector count [ aria - hidden ] 2,609,973 .hidden 1,556,017 .hide 1,389,540 .sr - only 583,126 .visually - hidden 136,635 .visuallyhidden 116,269 .invisible 113,473 [ hidden ] 31,290   no - js html class   when javascript libraries like modernizr run , the no - js class is removed and it ’s replaced with js . this way you can apply different css rules depending on whether javascript is enabled or not in your browser .   we found a total number of 844,242 elements whose html class list contains the no - js string . more than 92 % of them are html elements .   if you ’re wondering about the remaining 8 % , check out the top 10 :   element count html 782,613 body 31,256 a 17,833 div 7,364 meta 1,104 ul 905 li 789 nav 768 span 431 article 263   noscript   the html noscript element defines a section of markup that acts as an alternate content for users that have client - side scripting disabled , or whose browser lacks support . the client - side scripting language is usually javascript .   we found 3,536,247 noscript elements within the 8 million top twenty google results .   amp   accelerated mobile pages ( amp ) is a google initiative which aims to speed up the mobile web . most publishers are making their content available in parallel in the amp format .   to let google and other platforms know about it , you need to link the amp and non - amp pages together .   within the 8 million pages we looked at , we found only 1,944 non - amp pages referencing their amp version using rel = amphtml .   links attributes & values   we found 2,002,716 a elements with href=\"javascript : void(0 ) \" . whether you ’re coding a button or coding a link , you ’re doing it wrong .   href=”javascript : void(0 ) ”   ( a ) you ’re coding a button with the wrong element   ( b ) you ’re coding a link with the wrong technology   – heydon pickering   target=_blank w/ or w/o rel = noopener   43,924,869 of the anchors we analyzed are using target=\"_blank \" without a rel=\"noopener \" conjunction . in this case , if rel=\"noopener \" is missing , you are leaving your users open to a phishing attack and it ’s considered a security vulnerability .   anchor / link count [ target=_blank ] 43,924,869 [ rel = noopener ] 40,756 [ target=_blank][rel = noopener ] 35,604   mdn :   when using target you should consider adding rel=”noopener noreferrer ” to avoid exploitation of the window.opener api .   ben halpern and mathias bynens also wrote some good articles on this matter and the common advice is : do n’t use target=_blank , unless you have good reasons .   it seems it is a common practice to use # top as a href value to redirect the user to the top section of the current page . there were found 377,486 a elements with href=#top values .   lang   léonie watson :   the html lang attribute is used to identify the language of text content on the web . this information helps search engines return language specific results , and it is also used by screen readers that switch language profiles to provide the correct accent and pronunciation .   of the 8,021,323 pages that we were able to look into , 5,368,133 use the lang attribute on the html element . that ’s about 70 % !   div   the average web page has around 71 div s. this number was computed after counting all the div elements ( 576,067,185 ) encountered within 8,021,323 million pages .   header vs footer   2,358,071 of pages use the header element while the footer is used by 2,363,665 pages . also we found that only 2,117,448 of pages are using both header and footer .   element count footer 2,363,665 header 2,358,071   links are not buttons   neither are div ‘s and span ‘ s.   element attribute & value count a class = btn 3,251,114 a class = button 2,776,660 span class = button 292,168 div class = button 278,996 span class = btn 202,054 div class = btn 131,950   in exchange , here are the native buttons statistics :   selector count button 4,237,743 input[type = image ] 1,030,802 input[type = button ] 916,268   buttons without a specified type   speaking of buttons , the button element has a default type of submit . make sure you always specify the button type , because we found around 1,336,990 button elements with missing type attribute . that ’s around 31.5 % from the total of button s found in the wild .   bem syntax   if you ’re a css addict , you may have heard about bem , which is a popular naming convention for html classes .   knowing the bem naming style that consists of strings containing double - underscores or / and double - dashes , we were able to guess that only 20,463 elements use the bem naming style .   bootstrap & font awesome   apparently , we found only 1,711 pages that link to css or javascript resources that contain the bootstrap[.min.].js|.css . also , it looks like 379 pages link to css resources that contain the font - awesome[.min.].css .   i would have expected more .   wordpress   1,866,241 pages , from the total that we analyzed , contain < meta name=\"generator \" content=\"*wordpress * \" > . we can only assume there are more that use wordpress , but some chose to remove this meta info from their sources .   .clearfix vs .clear vs .cf   there are many naming styles for this well - known css utility that help clearing the floats . here ’s the breakdown :   selector count .clearfix 19,573,521 .clear 10,925,887 .cf 1,102,698   favicon   modern browsers fetch /favicon.ico automatically and asynchronously . so do n’t manually specify its root location , just place it in there . unless , for some reasons you prefer a different location for it .   it looks like 354,024 publishers still link the /favicon.ico in the head .   void elements   to close or not to close the void elements , that is the question . although fine with html either way , it is recommended to not close the void elements . at least for the sake of brevity .   element count < img/ > 121,463,561 < br/ > 67,595,285 < link/ > 61,746,984 < meta/ > 46,688,572 < br > 34,492,680 < input/ > 27,845,389 < img > 17,844,667 < meta > 15,133,457 < link > 11,740,839 < input > 7,231,827 < hr/ > 2,610,890 < hr > 1,690,891 < param/ > 1,390,339 < area/ > 1,336,974 < area > 1,025,183 < param > 698,611 < source/ > 435,877 < base/ > 389,717 < embed/ > 304,954 < source > 286,380 < wbr > 237,606 < col/ > 151,757 < col > 145,434 < base > 105,688 < wbr/ > 77,922 < embed > 56,610 < track/ > 376 < track > 310 < keygen/ > 1 < keygen > –   tabindex   on hijacking the tab order , when using tabindex to solve some disconnected ui elements , usually that only pushes the issue up to the document level .   the common advice is to use it with caution . we did notice that 552,109 html elements are using the tabindex attribute to override the defaults when navigating with a keyboard .   missing alt for images   this eternal seo and accessibility issue still seems to be pretty common after analyzing this set of data . from the total of 139,308,228 images , almost half are missing the alt attribute or use it with a blank value .   element count img 139,308,228 img alt= \" * \" 73,430,818 img alt= \" \" 32,603,650 img w/ missing alt 33,273,760   custom elements   excluding the web component tags , here is a list of made up tags or custom elements , different to mdn ’s html element reference .   element count < o :p > 808,253 < g : plusone > 273,166 < fb : like > 111,806 < asp : label > 76,501 < inline > 53,026 < noindex > 51,604 < icon > 42,703 < block > 34,167 < red > 33,424 < ss > 27,451   we did find 21,403 h7 elements too .   a11y   first rule of aria use :   if you can use a native html element [ html51 ] or attribute with the semantics and behaviour you require already built in , instead of re - purposing an element and adding an aria role , state or property to make it accessible , then do so .   landmark roles   aria landmark roles help users using assistive technology devices to navigate your site .   you might have seen this warning message when validating a document : “ the banner role is unnecessary for element header ” . this happens because browsers like ios safari do not currently support the above implicit mappings and for now it ’s a good practice to keep adding these landmark roles and avoid the html validation warnings .   regarding the html5 implicit mappings , here ’s the stats :   element count < nav role = navigation > 1,144,750 < header role = banner > 675,970 < footer role = contentinfo > 613,454 < main role = main > 236,484 < article role = article > 129,845 < aside role = complementary > 105,627 < section role = region > 4,326   autoplay   video and audio autoplay is considered a bad practice , not only for accessibility , but also for usability .   so , do n’t auto - play and it will please all of your users .   check out below the findings from the total of 108,321 video and 64,212 audio elements .   element count < video autoplay > 31,653 < video autoplay = true > 5,601 < audio autoplay > 2,595 < audio autoplay = true > 339 < video autoplay = false > 79 < audio autoplay = false > 22   maximum - scale define maximum zoom and when set like maximum - scale=1 it wo n’t allow the users to zoom your page . you should n’t do that , since zooming is an important accessibility feature that is used by a lot of people because it provides a better experience by meeting users ’ needs .   warning from html 5.2 editor ’s draft , 4 october 2016 :   authors should not suppress or limit the ability of users to resize a document , as this causes accessibility and usability issues .   however , we did find 1,047,294 websites using maximum - scale=1 and 87,169 websites with a user - scalable = no value set . at the same time , 326,658 pages are using both maximum - scale=1 and user - scalable = no .   setting role = button for a button is allowed but not recommended as the button already has role = button as default implicit aria semantic . still , we did find 26,360 button elements having set a role = button .   here ’s a breakdown on other notable elements , whose behavior was overridden by role = button :   element count < a role = button > 577,905 < div role = button > 85,565 < span role = button > 21,466 < input role = button > 8,286   on making clickable things correctly , mdn sums it up :   be careful when marking up links with the button role . buttons are expected to be triggered using the space key , while links are expected to be triggered using the enter key . in other words , when links are used to behave like buttons , adding role=”button ” alone is not sufficient . it will also be necessary to add a key event handler that listens for the space key in order to be consistent with native buttons .   svg   there are several ways of including svg in html , we sum them up and found a total of 5,610,764 svg references .   how to use svg % inline svg code within html 97.05 % using svg as an < img > 2.88 % using svg as an < object > 0.05 % using svg as an < embed > 0.02 % using svg as an < iframe > –   the object , iframe and embed methods usage is under 1 % .   there are 17,920 elements whose data- * attribute value contains the string svg . most of the elements are < svg > or < img > .   top 5 data- * values :   http://www.w3.org/2000/svg – 471 hg - svg – 127 svg - siteline - facebook – 114 icon-facebook.svg – 95 twitter.svg – 95   there are 141,813 elements whose i d attribute value contains the string “ svg ” . most of the elements are < svg > or its inner elements .   top 5 i d values :   emotion - header - title - svg – 16,281 cicleftbtnsvg – 5,793 cicpausebtnsvg – 5,793 cicplaybtnsvg – 5,793 cicrightbtnsvg – 5,793   there are 329,004 elements whose class attribute value contains the string “ svg ” . most of the elements are < svg > , < i > , < img > or inner elements .   top 10 class values :   sqs -

image ( the journey ! )   to figure out if an element used svg for a background - image , things were more complicated . most of our data only used the html documents , but we worked out a solution to get the active stylesheets .   from the total of 6,359,031 domains we were able to gather data from , 84.5 % ( 5,371,806 ) are using html elements with css background images , whilst only 1.2 % ( 82,008 ) domains were using at least one svg background image .   also , from the total of 92,388,615 html elements with css background images , 0.5 % ( 439,447 ) of them are using a svg background image .   the process   we went through all of the html files and transformed local / relative css file references into absolute ones , e.g. < link rel=\"stylesheet \" href=\"style.css \" > became < link rel=\"stylesheet \" href=\"http://www.domain.com / style.css \" > .   this took some time , since we sampled a couple of the results from our first runs , found inconsistencies with the results and had to restart the process . with a zipped file size of 65 gb ( and unzipped 323 gb ) , it was n’t a surprise why processing needed a couple of days to produce the above set of results .   trying and aborting phantomjs   since background images can be applied via css , we needed something to render the dom and apply styles to it . we thought of a tool we were very familiar with : phantomjs . we ran a couple of tests with actual pages and saw that everything seemed to work properly . we then built our java client to interface with the phantomjs webserver : starting , opening pages , extracting output , handling responses , saving results and then cleaning up , but ran into disastrous performance results when trying to use and scale the rendering process on even one machine .   rendering one html file would take anything from a couple of seconds to a couple of minutes and we had no way of knowing what phantomjs was doing . this , coupled with the fact that the resources usage goes up exponentially the larger the dom is , caused us to ditch it and look for alternatives .   better luck with selenium   as luck would have it , a colleague was experimenting with selenium on top of headless chrome . since he had encouraging results in all areas where phantomjs was lacking , we thought about leaving the java - do - it - all comfort zone and delegating stuff to other tools if needed . the test results were very promising – headless chrome looked like it suited our needs marvelously : super fast startup time , great rendering time , and full control over stopping a process .   the selenium web driver would actually close the binary , as opposed to us sending an exit command to phantomjs and hoping it was n’t in 100 % load so it would actually process it . this allowed us to control each process individually , without having to use killall every couple of minutes and stopping all processes in case just one of them went rogue and throttled the cpu .   the only problem with this approach was that the javascript could no longer be contained in a single , standalone js file we ’d pass onto the phantomjs executable , but had to be included inline in the actual html files . here ’s a simplified version of the script we used , relying on the window.getcomputedstyle ( ) method :   let backgroundimages = [ ] , allelem = document.queryselectorall ( \" * \" ) , allelemlength = allelem.length ; for ( let i = 0 ; i < allelemlength ; i++ ) { let style = window.getcomputedstyle(allelem[i ] , false ) , backgroundimage = style.backgroundimage.slice(4 , -1 ) ; backgroundimages.push(backgroundimage ) ; }   saving data would be done by calling a simple php script . we ran a couple of larger - scale tests to validate our choice and everything performed flawlessly , so we went on with setting up a scalable environment .   we processed all html files ( again ) and injected the above javascript snippet . the next challenge was uploading everything to amazon . s3browser , which we use for “ casual ” listing and downloading / uploading , did n’t seem fast enough for this job ( not the free version , at least ) . so , we looked for an alternative and came across s3 - parallel - put .   we set it up on a local linux machine , moved over the ssd and had 65 gb worth of zipped text data uploaded in no time . it crippled our machine and the local jenkins server that was running on it – until we upgraded the old q9550 cpu :) .   the problems showed up when starting to scale up . we saw that our single web server would become overwhelmed and stop saving results , even though the selenium driver was reporting the page had rendered successfully . this also meant many of our queue messages would be wasted ( consumed and deleted from the queue ) , without producing any results .   we thus decided to have a more scrutinized system for keeping track of processed / unprocessed files by using redis : each time we ’d start processing a file , we ’d insert the domain name into a redis set . each time we ’d process a file ( our php script would be called ) , we ’d insert the domain name into another redis set . the point was to keep the difference between the two to a minimum ( anything over a certain value would mean something was n’t working properly ) and to make retrying easy if it was ever going to be needed .   hardware setup   for our hardware setup , we started by running 10 threads * 1 chrome instance each on 10 amazon c4.large machines , served by one apache webserver running on a m3.medium initially doing a very lousy job . after toying with apache ’s settings , we scaled everything up gradually and got to 40 c4.large machines being served by apache webservers running on 4 m3.medium machines behind a load balancer . our redis instance was serving all 10 threads * 40 machines * 3 - 4 requests per 5 - 20 seconds off a r3.large machine . so , that ’s about 60 - 320 requests per second .   on costs , it ’s pretty hard to give a total amount of money spent or cpu - time , since we ran into many issues before having a fully functional and stable ecosystem . ideally , a single machine would need about 45 seconds for processing 100 files : downloading , unzipping , rendering and cleaning up .   q&a / follow up   why so many tbody elements ?   for the above new data , we did perform another full scan for the 8 million documents and also fixed a parsing sanitization issue where the jsoup parser was adding the tbody element automatically for all the tables . this is the answer to the question asked by some of you in the comments : “ why so many tbody elements ? ” .   as a consequence , the number of elements used on the most pages is now 25 , tbody stats being now lessened .   body at 99 % ?   a little refresher : according to the specifications , omitting the body is fine : start tag : optional , end tag : optional .   so , one of the most surprising results number , based on your comments , was the missing 1 % of body elements . i guess i owe you an answer , for that i went a bit further and ran the parser again to get some insights :   as some of you already guessed , most of the pages are missing the body tag due to the high frameset usage .   tag due to the high usage . the client -

              " 'advanced content tracking with universal analytics . a while ago i wrote advanced content tracking – a post about how to measure if users are actually reading your content . i ’ve been getting a lot of requests to update this code for universal analytics .   so here it is – an updated script specifically for use with universal analytics .   this google analytics customization collects data as users scroll down a page . it uses events to track when a post loads , when the user scrolls more than 150 pixels , when the user reaches the bottom of the content and when the user reaches the bottom of the page .   the end result is some cool data about how many users actually read content . here ’s a sample of what the data looks like . this is just an basic event report with the event action and event label .   the scroll tracking code   here is the javascript code that measures user scrolling .     tip – you can use the tabs at the top of the code window to try the script . just click on result .     what ’s changed in this version ?   first , the blog post title is now collected as part of the event . specifically i ’m pulling the page title from the html and putting it into the event label . this makes it easier to drill down and see which pages people are reading . this was possible before using the page title dimension , but using the event label makes it just a bit easier . see the image above .   another thing i change is i now use a custom dimension rather than a custom variable , to collect the ‘ reader type ’ . custom variables do not exist in universal analytics .   this change will impact your data ! you will no longer see data in the custom variables report – because you ’re not using custom variables . custom dimensions are only available in custom reports and custom dashboards .   i also changed how the custom dimensions are set . this script will set a custom dimension when the user reaches the bottom of the post content – not the bottom of the page . when they reach the bottom of the content they are categorized as a scanner or a reader .   a scanner is someone that simple scrolls to the bottom of the content in less than 60 seconds .   a reader is someone that take more than 60 seconds to reach the bottom of the content .   this is hardly a scientific way to categorize users , but it works for me :)   finally , i added three custom metrics to store the time metrics : time to scroll , time to content bottom and time to page bottom .   remember , in order to configure custom dimensions and custom metric you must first add them via your google analytics admin settings .   other than the above changes the functionality is still the same .   implementing the code   step 1 : there are a few code changes that you must make in order for this code to work on your site .   1 . turn off debugging : this flag will display alert messages , rather than send ga data , when the user scrolls , reaches the bottom of the content and reaches the bottom of the page . if you do not set this to false your users will get all sorts of alert messages :)   2 . decide how far you want for scroll depth : i send an event after the user scrolls 150 px . you can change this value , but i believe it works fine and does capture user engagement .   3 . specify where the bottom of your content is : this is the most important setting . this script sends an event when the user gets to the bottom of a post . that ’s determined by the html . for me , the html is identified as .entry - content , as shown in this code .   [ code lang=”js ” ]   if ( bottom > = $ ( ‘ .entry - content’).scrolltop ( ) + $ ( ‘ .entry - content’).innerheight ( ) & & ! endcontent ) {   [ /code ]   you must change this line of code to identify a piece of html on your site that signifies the end of the content . this is the hardest part of the implementation .   step 2 : add the code before the closing [ code][/code ] on your site . make sure it appears after the universal analytics page tag . it should look something like this when complete :   [ code lang=”js ” ]   < head >   … all sorts of tags …   < script >   //   // universal analytics page tag   //   ( function(i , s , o , g , r , a , m){i[‘googleanalyticsobject’]=r;i[r]=i[r]||function ( ) {   ( i[r].q = i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new date();a = s.createelement(o ) ,   m = s.getelementsbytagname(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src = g;m.parentnode.insertbefore(a , m )   } ) ( window , document,’script’,’//www.google - analytics.com / analytics.js’,’ga ’ ) ;   ga(‘create ’ , ‘ ua - xxxxxx - yy ’ ) ;   ga(‘send ’ , ‘ pageview ’ ) ;   //   // scroll tracking script   //   jquery(function($ ) {   // debug flag   var debugmode = true ;   // default time delay before checking location   var callbacktime = 100 ;   // # px before tracking a reader   var readerlocation = 150 ;   // set some flags for tracking & execution   var timer = 0 ;   var scroller = false ;   var endcontent = false ;   var didcomplete = false ;   … more code here …   < /script >   [ /code ]   that should be it . you should see data instantly in the real time event reports .   i encourage you to read the instructions in my original post .   finally , a lot of people have asked me about implementing this script with google tag manager . this really warms my heart :) i love tag management !   you can use this script with google tag manager – but it takes a bit of work . i ’ll write a separate post on that topic .   that ’s it . i hope you find this script useful . feel free to modify it to fit your needs . i ’ve really enjoyed the data that it generates – it ’s helped me better understand my readers and content .',\n",

              " '25 tips for updating old blog posts for seo & boosting organic traffic . earlier this year , we updated 24 old blog posts . the result ? a 75 % increase in website traffic .   imagine the impact you ’d experience by almost doubling your website traffic . you ’d see more sign - ups , email subscribers , and revenue , right ?   while most teams focus on pumping out new content , the reality is , you can generate more results from tending to the content that ’s already been published on your website .   chances are , you ’ve got a backlog of old content on your website , posts that have n’t been touched in the 2 + years since you published them .   but while you might not be checking in with them , there ’s a possibility that your target customers ( and google ) are visiting them regularly . if they ’re not up - to - scratch , it could be sabotaging your entire content marketing strategy .   in this guide , we ’ll talk about :   why is it important to update old blog posts ?   before we dive in , let ’s cover the foundations and think about why you should be updating old blog posts ( instead of just hitting “ publish ” on a new piece every week . )   updating old content helps with these three areas :   get more backlinks   “ your blog post is now fully up to date and relevant to your audience again . if you ’re the first among your content competitors to update a post on a particular topic , you are in a prime position to poach their existing backlinks , ” says john butterworth of crcc asia .   “ the reason for this ? no external site wants to link to outdated content . ”   “ for example , if you ’ve updated a blog post on academy award winners to include 2020 ’s results , but your competitors have n’t , then sites linking to your competitor ’s post are linking to outdated content . ”   “ by using a backlink checker tool , such as ahrefs , you can see which sites are linking to your competitor ’s post . from there , reach out to those sites and inform them that they ’re linking to yesterday ’s news and offer your newly updated blog post as an alternative . ”   “ in my experience , the owners of these sites are delighted that somebody has done the hard work for them and are more than willing to link to your blog post . ”   related : 29 free link building tips for building links on little - to - no budget   build reader loyalty   we ’ve touched on the fact that readers ( and potential customers ) might be landing on your outdated content .   “ simply by keeping our entire content up - to - date provides a certain brand trust and loyalty as readers understand that we ’re not creating content just for the sake of building fresh content , but to share helpful guides and provide value , ” latana‘s joy corkery explains .   stay up - to - date with seo best practices   kiwi creative‘s dylan zsigray explains that “ it ’s important to not forget about the best practices associated with seo . ”   “ the industry practices for blogs in 2017 differ from the best practices today , so it ’s best also to take a look at your headings , blog structure , links , and images to ensure you ’re meeting the ranking factors google is looking for . ”   it ’s true : if we look at seo best practices back in 2010 , you ’d be advised to keyword stuff and build black hat links – two practices that could land a google penalty , should you do them today .   reviewing old content , and bringing them up to modern - day standards , is a great way to make sure they ’re seo - friendly .   how to choose which content to refresh ?   now that we know why updating old content should be a priority for your website let ’s move onto the tricky part : finding the blog posts you should refresh .   our experts have three ways to do this :   look at pages with lots of high - quality links   when choosing which old content to update , zety‘s michael tomaszews recommends “ find the blogs on your site that have racked up some solid links from other outlets , but that do n’t rank particularly well . ”   “ these pages have lots of authority and a ranking potential that ’s worth its weight in gold . all you need to do next is to give the page a refresh , and sooner or later , you ’ll see a spike in traffic . ”   find pages with the most traffic   “ my one tip for updating old blog posts is to focus on the pages that have the most traffic first , ” says thomas brodbeck of found search marketing .   “ i have talked to others who focus on updating the oldest posts first , but i think updating the posts that have the most traffic to serve the user best . ”   brodbeck continues : “ when looking at your most trafficked blog posts and see what data might be dated and look to see if new information has come about . i recommend looking over your blog posts a couple of times a year with the help of an seo dashboard . ”   juli durante of impulse creative adds : “ the most important part of updating old blog posts for seo , for me , is making sure the posts you update are posts where you * want * to grow traffic . ”   “ i ’ve often seen someone update the 10 oldest posts – that ’s great , and i would venture to guess that those 10 old posts could use a refresh in general , but do they convert well ? do you have newer content that is related to them ? is it a topic that still matters today ? ”   “ a blog republishing strategy should be looking forward as actively as it is looking backward , ” durante says .   use this seo dashboard software to identify the blog articles with the highest number of traffic .   prioritize pages with lots of keyword impressions but low rankings   when picking content to start with , scorpion‘s emily brady advises to “ be smart about which posts you choose to update . i ’m a huge fan of updating old posts for seo , but it only works if you target the right content . ”   “ one way to do this is through google search console . you can filter your urls by blog ( if your site is organized that way ) , then start looking for queries that have a lot of impressions and are within striking distance of ranking . ”   “ depending on how successful your site is , “ within striking distance ” could mean an average position between 6 and 16 . again , this is relative to how well the majority of your blogs are already performing . ”   “ then , see which page is showing up for that query . that ’s the page you probably want to revamp next ! ”   katie gerweck of pure visibility adds : “ you can use an seo tool like ahrefs to identify blogs that are currently ranking on page 2 of the search results . these pages are good candidates for updating because they likely have the potential to rank on page 1 , but need additional optimization to get there . ”   * editor ’s note : do n’t fancy digging through your google search console account to find these opportunities ? our decaying site pages & posts dashboard template does it for you . you ’ll see how the organic sessions and clicks change for each page over time :   do n’t waste time updating old content that does n’t need to be updated   it can be easy to think that every blog post should be added to your “ update ” list .   however , chelsea roller of rank fuse interactive says : “ our number one tip for updating old blog posts is to make sure a post truly needs to be updated . you do n’t want to waste time and resources on updating a blog post before it really needs to be redone . ”   you should be creating a process for this – something 67 % of experts we polled said they have :   roller continues : “ to do this , we use tools like moz and semrush to perform content audits . these tools allow us to see if traffic on our blogs has started to decline and show us how we can improve our content with keywords . ”   “ we often find that we need a refresh every year to year and a half , and if we are repurposing or redoing content too quickly , google does n’t always keep up as well as we ’d like . also , if we are constantly updating one post , we do n’t have time to update others or create new content . ”   “ for this reason , we try to come back to a piece of content a year after it was written to reevaluate the content , data , keywords , images , and anything else that is part of the blog . however , if it is still performing really well , we might only make a couple of minor changes , ” roller adds .   summarizing , borislav ivanov of best response media says : “ the main thing is to make sure you have a reason to update the content . just because it is old does n’t mean that it is not good enough or that it is no longer valid . ”   how often should you update old blog posts   earlier , we shared the three techniques you can use to determine which old blog posts should be updated .   for the majority of our experts , this is once a quarter :     one important thing to note is the lifetime value and lifespan of a blog post .   according to a study commissioned by izea and executed by the halverson group , it was discovered that it takes about two years for a blog post to reach the maximum number ( 99 % ) of its impressions .   more interestingly , the study found that most blog posts undergo three unique life phases , including :   shout phase : the blog post records an exponential increase in impressions ( about 50 % of its impressions ) in the first 7 - 10 days .   : the blog post records an exponential increase in impressions ( about 50 % of its impressions ) in the first 7 - 10 days . echo phase : the blog post realizes 72 % of its impressions ; this usually lasts for about 30 days after the shout phases elapses .   the blog post realizes 72 % of its impressions ; this usually lasts for about 30 days after the shout phases elapses . reverberate : the blog post records the remaining 28 % of its impressions over the duration of 30 - 700 days .   with this in mind , we can all agree that there are tons of opportunities provided by updating your old blog posts , such as generating clicks , impressions , and conversions .   so , how do you update and republish your old blog posts for improved seo ?   25 ways to update old blog posts for seo   you ’ve got a list of old blog posts you want to refresh for an seo ( and user experience ) boost .   but what does a “ content refresh ” actually look like ?   we asked 100 + experts

current , i always look for mid - tier pages that are getting some traffic but not enough … then see if there are other posts i can combine it with , ” says barrel‘s sean collins .   “ this increases traffic to the post and reduces the number of pages on the site , keeping it cleaner , more navigable , and faster . ”   it ’s a tactic also used by websurge , as kendall brittingham explains : “ look for old blog posts with similar topics , concepts , and themes and see which post is performing better in terms of traffic , interaction , and rank in the search engine . ”   “ if it naturally makes sense to do so , add the content and/or themes from the weaker - performing posts to strengthen the high - performer . then , draft and redirect the posts you used to the updated , strengthened blog post . ”   brittingham continues : “ this accomplishes three goals . first , it lengthens the original blog post with content that is n’t fluff , and search engines generally prefer content - rich pages . ”   “ second , it eliminates duplicate content from your blog that is potentially competing against itself for a specific keyword in the search engine , and it ’s easier to optimize and rank for one blog post than multiple . ”   “ lastly , it ’s using quality content that you already have , saving you time on content creation without sacrificing content quality . ”   jesse teske of jct growth explains : “ i often see websites publish the same content after a few years . the content then cannibalizes other content , which causes rankings and traffics to erode . merging and refreshing the content often results in significant gains . ”   in fact , this could help meet kevin dhimitri‘s advice to “ bring them up to a minimum of 500 words , if the blog post is n’t already . in so many of the new projects i take on , we find old blog posts that are only around 100 words and lack any seo whatsoever . it ’s best to add content to them so that it ranks for more keywords and avoids being flagged as low - quality content . ”   alltimepower‘s aaron luther summarizes : “ combine old and “ thin ” content into larger , more comprehensive blogs . this will serve you in two ways by eliminating thin content from your website and creating larger , more authoritative pieces at the same time . ”   2 . add the current year to the heading tag   “ one of the strategies i learned from brain dean is how to repurpose an old blog , ” says film jackets ‘ syed ali .   “ the first thing readers come across is the meta title and h1 ; for example , you wrote a guide back in 2018 “ how to style a leather jacket . ” the blog is old , and there have been many changes in fashion since 2018 . ”   ali continues : “ whether you add video , more content , or keywords , never forget to change the title to “ how to style a leather jacket [ 2020 updated ] . ” this will indicate both readers and google that the blog is recently updated . ”   upskilled‘s elizabeth orland adds : “ key features like old dates create a lack of authority and trustworthiness from both a user and seo perspective . ”   according to daniel ashton of sportsman ’s bail bonds , “ titles with the year in them have a higher click - through rate , and as you come to a new year , you can make any updates that are relevant in the article and change the title to include the newer date . ”   “ this allows you to republish the article , and it is basically like having a new piece of content with all of the heavy lifting already done . ”   3 . update meta tags for content with low ctrs   when updating content , dragapp‘s samantha anacleto advises “ to constantly check google analytics , looking for pages with a low ctr ( click through rate ) , that is the number of clicks on a page divided for the number of impressions on it , and multiplied to 100 . ”   “ it shows how many people are seeing your blog post on google search , and how many are attracted to click on it . ”   “ the pages with low ctr are the ones you need to start the process : updating metadata and title to make them more appealing , ” anacleto continues . “ check your competitors that are ranking well , try to come up with a better title and meta description then theirs . ”   manny hernandez of wealth growth wisdom explains : “ making your title tag “ more clickable ” and/or incorporating some key modifiers in the title tag can be hugely helpful in driving more traffic ( ranking better for specific terms and getting more clicks in the search results you ’re already showing in ) , but you want to be sure not to undermine your current rankings and ctr . ”   “ you can look in google search console to see which terms are currently driving impressions for a specific page before making any tweaks to the title tag . ”   4 . answer recent “ people often ask ” questions   “ one way to update old blog posts is to add in answers to queries people often have about the topic , ” says hannah fisher of hvac supreme .   “ for example , search your keyword in google and look at the people often ask feature . answer those questions in your blog post if you can , either by creating a section for faqs or by creating a few short new sections in the article . this will help you increase your word count too . ”   tony mastri of marion internal marketing has a similar approach : “ use search console to look at search queries filtered by your old blog post url . extend the date range to 6 months or more , and check out sort by average position . ”   “ look at queries that had a high average position . if those queries are relevant to your post , consider adding new sections around those topics or questions . by expanding on your original post with relevant topics that searchers are seeking out , you can become a better match for their queries with your updated content . ”   tom zsomborgi says kinsta has found , “ you need to add at least 15 - 20 % more fresh and new content to your old post to see a significant increase in traffic ; small updates will rarely move the needle . ”   5 . improve your search intent match   when updating old blog posts for seo , cynthia kaui of agile it says : “ one tip is to keep in mind search intent . take a step back and consider if the “ old ” blog post that you are going to update for seo purposes makes sense . ”   “ for instance , is the blog recent enough , and does it have relevant content to what you are looking to rank for in keywords ? ”   floor 500‘s curt storring explains : “ in other words , does this piece of content fully answer the question the searcher was asking when typing their query into google ? this is not always just a keyword thing , but rather , what can you deduce that their end goal would be based on their query ? ”   “ i like to see what google is ranking on page 1 to tell what google believes search intent is . i then see what type of content is ranking . are blog posts still ranking ? videos ? calculators and tools ? ”   “ if blog posts are still ranking , i ’ll go through and see what topics the other articles cover that i am missing in my piece . then , you can update your old post , both to match intent and content type , ” storring continues .   “ you might need to make it much shorter ( breaking an “ ultimate guide ” into multiple posts ) , or much longer . you might need to add more images or videos . perhaps your page would benefit from getting a helpful calculator made that you can embed on the page . ”   6 . add internal links when updating content   “ when it comes to updating and optimizing blog posts , there are many different things that [ twenty over ten ] like to do to keep out content fresh and current , but since we ’re only choosing one , something i would give for advice would be to keep the content fresh , ” says samantha russell .   “ if there are new features about something on your website or business , or you want to link to updated content , then that is what i would suggest first . ”   “ we create blog posts every day , so we constantly have fresh posts , so there is almost always something to link . it ’s a great idea to link them on older posts and then update and refresh those . ”   eric allen of border west marketing explains why this is important : “ if this is done properly , it will improve user experience leading to visitors spending more time on your site . ”   “ this will also improve seo . internal links are the roadmap that guides search engines through your site . by updating older posts with links to newer posts , you ’re providing a better map while simultaneously helping improve the seo for the newer pages . ”   roberto torres of turrem technology also advises to “ make sure you have internal links to those old posts from your newer posts and from your old posts to your new posts . this will allow the reader to find the content easily , and according to moz , will benefit seo by establishing site architecture and spreading link equity . ”   assemblo‘s steve de niese adds : “ one of our biggest updates for seo with older content is integrating new related content as links that expand on the talking points within popular articles . this can even include writing new pieces to expand on points in these strong performing pieces . ”   while doing this , miva‘s luke wester adds that you can “ implement the seo topic cluster strategy when updating your old blogs . group similar blogs into a topic cluster , interlink them , and create a pillar piece that unites them all . ”   summarizing , brian barwig of integrate digital marketing adds : “ once you create new posts / pages , update internal linking on old blog posts to get new pages crawled and indexed , increase authority on both new and old pages , keep readers on your site , and establish the architecture of the website . ”   related : how to use internal links to boost seo and user experience   7 . link to new research studies   “ nothing ages a piece of content like an outdated source or report – especially if it ’s in an evergreen piece of content or a topic that ’s trending again , ” coral luck of wyatt international explains .   “ ultimately , you ’re doing this to provide the user with the most reliable piece of content – as long as you ’re putting the user first , your seo efforts should align . it will also help with e - a - t and page quality . updating your content to align with the newest source or report is n’t difficult and should n’t take too long to do . ”   “ if the new source or report changes the sentiment of your older piece of content , then it ’s time to write a new piece and reference just how much the industry has changed . ”   matt zajechowski of digital third coast adds : “ if you have call - out statistics in an old blog post , take the time to survey as many relevant people as you can on the same question or questions . this allows you to provide the most up to date data on the subject and also showcase year over year trends . ”   “ i constantly have media contacts asking for year - over - year data on a popular subject , so people in the media are hungry for this type of data . this is an easy and effective way to update a new post and re - promote it with the new and up - to - date call - out data . ”   8 . scan for ( and remove ) broken external links   “ i ca n’t tell you how many times i click through a linked statistic on a ‘ recent ’ article , only to find that the citation is from 2016 , ” says wiza‘s brooklin nash .   “ update your research and external links . please , for the love of moz , make the ‘ old ’ content truly more valuable by updating your statistics . ”   you should also check that any external links actually work , as john donnachie of clydebank media explains : “ it can be easy to forget about older content and not only do broken links and images reduce your visitor experience but they are a red flag for site quality in the eyes of search engines . ”   clique studios ‘ megan wenzl adds that “ you can use a tool called check my links to make sure all links in your article are valid . if you find broken or irrelevant links , update the article with a valid , relevant link . ”   aj mens of blog pioneer adds : “ does the post link to external articles that do n’t exist anymore ? or does the post link to articles that are not as relevant anymore as they used to be ? replace them with links to better , more relevant articles . ”   plus , namebounce‘s axel deangelis says : “ your goal should be to fix broken links and link to updated external content . google loves fresh content , and having recent links in your post will serve as a strong indicator that your content is new .   as womply‘s dallin hatch summarizes : “ it ’s a good idea to revisit blog posts that are at least a year old and check for any dead or broken outbound links . not only do they create a bad user experience , but they signal to search engines that your content is old , outdated , or unauthoritative , thus lowering how your content ranks in search .   9 . add schema markup   schema markup is a special code that helps google spiders better - understand a page .   kent lewis explains : “ after testing the last few months extensively at anvil media , we ’ve found the greatest impact in terms of optimization of blog posts is twofold : adding schema markup and reformatting the old content to answer common questions on the topic . ”   “ we ’ve been able to take zero - traffic older blog posts and generate thousands of weekly impressions by lightly tweaking the content and adding schema to make the post more attractive to google as a possible position zero / voice search answer to common questions on the given topic . ”   related : the best structured data tools for seos and content marketers   10 . change the formatting or layout   “ when updating old blog posts , i like to ensure that the formatting and layout are up - to - date with current best practices in seo , ” brendan mcconnell of premium seo nz says .   “ for example , there are techniques you can use to improve your chances of being placed in a featured snippet position . these include adding a summary or definition of your target keyword , adding a number list near the top of the post that relates to your target keyword , and using the proper heading and subheadings to target keyword clusters . ”   mcconnell adds : “ these best practices change over time , so it ’s important to review your old blog post structures and update accordingly . ”   11 . take inspiration from your competitors   “ one tip that i would like to suggest for updating old blog posts for seo purposes is that always keep an eye on your top 5 competitors , keep a check on their blog , ” says gaditek‘s usama raudo .   “ identify the gaps ( keywords , images , etc . ) and utilize them properly and efficiently in your blogs . ”   to do this , bill ferris ’ team at decor interiors says you should “ enter your target keywords into google and see which competitor blog pages rank higher on serps than your article . visit each page and see how they incorporate the keyword in their content . ”   “ do they use it in headers , anchor text , faqs , image alt text , or filenames ? how is that different from your post ? ”   “ also , take the time to identify any cool things on the competitor ’s page that engaged your attention . chances are , you can enhance the visitor experience and time on the page by sprucing up visuals , graphics , tables , etc . too , ” ferris continues .   “ repeat this step for multiple competitors and keywords to build up your reservoir of “ new ” ideas . ”   12 . research the industry   “ one tip for updating old blog posts is to do some research on your topic or industry , ” says integritive‘s spencer andrews .   “ more often than not , industries are changing yearly , and new and better ideas are always coming into the market . doing some research to see changes that have occurred or are expected to occur is a great way to update an old blog post . ”   andrews adds : “ another tip is to see how your blog posting has changed and improved over time . are you adding more interactive content in your posts ? adding more pictures ? see how your style has changed and revamp some old blog posts by making them more interactive or easier to read for clients . this can improve traffic and keep reading engaged in your content . ”   brandelle palmer explains that green wellness life “ regularly go back and update old posts . the most important tip for updating old posts that i have is making the post as comprehensive as possible . ”   “ typically , older posts tend to be shorter in length because you did n’t use to need very long posts to rank 4 - 5 years ago . many spaces were not as competitive as they are now . ”   “ as you update your older posts , i would conduct a google search to see what is ranking now . make note of all the subtopics covered on every page that ranks for your topic on page one . then , incorporate all of those subtopics into your updated blog , ” palmer continues .   “ this can help ensure your blog post is the most comprehensive post on the web for that topic , which will give it a fighting chance to rank and drive meaningful traffic for you . ”   aaron wall of seo book explains : “ try to imagine a person searching for that information does not necessarily know the surrounding news stories or just happening events of the day when it was created . ”   “ adjust your content to put things into a better historical context and give a current sense of place of purpose and what has since changed . sometimes this would require a complete rewrite versus just adding a few sections here or there . ”   13 . boost rankings for keywords you ’re not ranking well for   when updating old blog posts , brittany berger recommends to “ see if the blog post is currently ranking well for keywords you had n’t thought of the first time optimizing . ”   “ these will often be longer tail versions of or related to your focus keyword , so you can easily work more info about them into your content without going off - topic . and if you ’re already ranking for that keyword without any focused effort , imagine the improvement just a little work will do . ”   you can find these using tools like google search console , semrush , or ahrefs ( shown below ):   mollie kuramoto explains that for element three , “ we look at which keywords a blog post is already ranking for and whether or not those keywords have increased or decreased over the past few months . ”   “ some keywords you wo n’t necessarily want to optimize towards because they might not be relevant to your piece of content or do n’t match the intent of the blog post , but others might be low hanging fruit that already has some traction ! ”   “ once you ’ve identified the keywords that could help boost organic traffic , you can optimize by adding new sections to the blog post , rewording headers , adding or updating imagery , and even improving meta descriptions to improve ctr in the serps , ” kuramoto says .   melissa teng of wit and folly adds that you can “ use ahref ’s site explorer tool to find the organic keywords that your blog article is currently ranking for . update the blog post to optimize for any keywords that the blog post is not optimized for yet . ”   fathercraft‘s paul zalewski agrees : “ going into search console to see what a post is already ranking for to find low - hanging fruit . especially keywords that are in positions 4 - 15 can usually be moved up significantly by refreshing the content and adding a section for that keyword ! ”   evan hall adds that for portent‘s old content , “ i ’ll consider targeting any keywords that are hovering around pages two and thee , or have a lot of impressions but not many clicks . ”   * editor ’s note : it ’s easier to find opportunities to edit content and boost your keyword rankings with our semrush position tracking dashboard template . it pulls data from your account and syncs it regularly , so you can easily spot keyword opportunities .   14 . target new keywords   to update an old blog post , dapzury valenzuela of the university of advancing technology thinks you should be “ adding relevant keywords and placing them in your blog title , headings , subheading , and introductory sentence . ”   “ you do n’t need too many as a few strategically placed keywords should do the trick . this helps search engines identify your new blog post as a positive result based on the revisions you made . ”   trinity owen of the pay at home parent thinks : “ you should target keywords with low search volumes that have a chance to rank than to target keywords with high volumes that will never rank . ”   that ’s why the team at hoot design co says , “ when it comes to updating old blog posts , an important step is to include current keywords in your titles and subtitles , and be sure they are coded correctly ( h1 , h2 , etc . ) . ”   “ to do this effectively , you must conduct a keyword audit , but it is a relatively easy and effective way to make old blogs work for your current seo strategy . ”   in fact , it ’s the most common activity that marketers complete when updating an old blog post :   plus , alayna okerlund of bestcompany.com adds : “ when doing this , you can focus on adding a good portion of fresh content that gives you not only additional keyword opportunities but also makes the blog post more relevant and interesting to your current audience . ”   tanya chopp of voices.com puts this into practice : “ consider an article optimized around how to set your voicemail versus voicemail scripts . ”   “ voicemail scripts might be the higher search term as it represents the biggest problem for those who are setting up their voicemail – they ’re not sure what to say . this alternate keyword is relevant to what the searcher is looking for and a crucial component to setting your voicemail – you may have just missed the opportunity to use the right term in your post . ”   “ these kinds of articles are the ones to go back into , add newly updated content to and reposition for search intent , using the right language , ” chopp continues .   however , alysha schultz of intuitive digital has a word of warning : “ when you have updated information to add to an old blog post , you ’ll first want to check and see what , if any keywords that blog is already ranking for , so you do n’t undo any hard ranking work you ’ve already done . ”   “ if those keywords are no longer in line with the information updates needed , no need to protect them in the content , and it ’s time to do new keyword research for that post . ”   related : 14 free ways to research and analyze keywords for blog posts   15 . insert videos or images   “ one of the best tips that i have for updating old blog posts would have to be adding in a video that is related to the keyword or topic of the article , ” says james canzanella of im nights .   “ this tactic is great for blog posts that are already getting some type of traffic . by adding a youtube video to the blog post , it can help improve the amount of time that visitors stay on your page , which google happens to love . ”   this is why michael creel of find your influence advises to “ create a video version of a high traffic blog post . publish your new video blog post to your own website first and then upload it to youtube . doing this helps expand the reach of your “ new and improved ” content . ”   “ search engines and users alike love them , ” hqdigital‘s meghan hultquist says . “ record a quick video that elaborates on your topic or provides a colorful example . you ’ll see increased time - on - page and search engine rankings . ”   design buffs ‘ carster pleiser adds that this helps with an important seo metric : “ there is strong evidence that dwell time , e.g. , the amount of time the average person spends on your blog post is connected to seo benefits . ”   “ a higher dwell time indicates high relevance and value , which is what google wants to see when it comes to prioritizing content in the serps . high quality , aesthetically pleasing , and engaging visuals can help with this . high - quality blogs have high - quality images and visuals , and users are more likely to stick around for a site that they perceive as professional , established , and trustworthy . ”   “ turning your data into an infographic , for example , might also attract hundreds of new backlinks , which can be an seo goldmine , ” pleiser continues .   “ the bottom line : if you ’re updating your blog for seo , do n’t just think about your copy and its content . instead , add high - quality visuals and images to increase dwell time and engage your audience . ”   16 . update product or app photos   “ old blog posts with evergreen content are great for bringing in new users continually , ” genuineclass‘s eileen mullin says .   “ i have one client who offers tech tips on his blog , and i help him make sure they are regularly updated as the software he writes about is updated . this includes updated screenshots to show the latest interface and how - to instructions that reference new menu names and new step - by - step instructions for clicking through . ”   17 . change the alt text of your images   “ one thing to pay attention to when updating old blog posts is the alt - text of photos , ” says fundera‘s ricardo velez . “ alt text not only improves the accessibility of your blog post , but it also improves your image seo . ”   “ good alt text should be descriptive of the image and stay under 125 characters . though it may be tempting , avoid keyword stuffing . ”   18 . set a schedule to update old content periodically   earlier , we shared the three techniques you can use to determine which old blog posts should be updated .   however , christina hager of ovations digital also recommends “ create a cycle of life for each piece of content – and this means creating a strategy about how and when you will update your old blog posts . ”   for the majority of our experts , this is once a quarter :   19 . avoid making too many drastic changes at once   “ the biggest tip i can give is to ensure when you are updating a blog post , you are doing so to provide extra value and not for the sake of updating it , ” says gaminggem‘s barry hutchinson .   “ this is particularly important if you are in a tech niche like myself . as items become outdated , out of stock , or better alternatives come along , you need to update it . ”   “ be careful though , particularly if the post is already ranking well . little and often is my rule when it comes to updating because if you have a post that is ranking well and completely overhaul it , you could actually lose your ranking . update small segments of the post and see where it sits a few weeks later . ”   rachel blakely - gray of patriot software adds : “ if it ’s already ranking for keywords , drawing in a lot of traffic , and/or getting a bit of love on social , do n’t be overzealous . ”   “ pay attention to what the blog post is currently doing well before giving it a makeover . sometimes , a few seo - friendly tweaks are all you need ! ”   20 . add expert quotes   when updating old blog posts for seo , brandon towl of words have impact has one tip : “ add expertise ! ”   “ eat ( expertise , authority , and trust ) is having a significant impact on search , and it ’s likely that older posts have not been sufficiently optimized with these in mind . add credibility to the post with external links , authoritative quotes , and relevant stats , for example . ”   ( take this blog post , for example . we include tons of expert quotes in our content to build authority . )   21 . do n’t change the url ( unless you have to )   “ yes , your older content can indeed benefit the authority of your website since it has been around for so long , ” says niles koenigsberg of fig advertising + marketing .   “ however , if the content is not relevant and it presents no value to the consumer , then it might be a better choice to simply delete the blog post and redirect the url . ”   ubisense‘s stefania borchia adds : “ most blog posts have the date in their url . while keeping the url of a blog post that worked well in the past , it might be perceived as “ less fresh ” compared to other relatively newer posts . therefore , i would recommend avoiding using dates in blogs ’ urls . ”   it can be tempting to change the url of your old content – whether to add the current year or better - reflect the content itself .   but andrew becks of 301 digital media has a word of warning : “ do n’t change the url unless it ’s absolutely necessary , and if you do , be sure to implement a 301 redirect . ”   22 . remove brand - specific references   the brands referenced in the content you published years ago likely wo n’t be relevant these days .   nita sweeney explains that you should think about this when updating old blog posts : “ did you mention using your blackberry ? how about your palm pilot ? removing specific brand references and using more generic terms transforms a dated post into something evergreen . ”   23 . rewrite your introduction   “ this is the first impression you make on your reader ( well , second after a killer title , which you should also consider revising – but not the url / slug ! ) and often it is rushed and impersonal , as you try to “ get to the important parts ” of the piece , ” says elisa doucette of craft your content .   “ but in your introduction , you should be giving the reader a reason to care . why should they want to read this piece ? what information might they get – or what might they learn ( maybe keep this one a little mysterious ; you do n’t want to give away all the free candy in your front lobby ! ) ? what ’s a super interesting fact or statistic that would pique their interest ? ”   “ think of it as you would approach any person for conversation . if you are trying not to be the most awkward human ever ( i speak from experience ) , you do n’t make some passing small talk comment and then launch into the intricacies of your thinking and research . instead , you tell them just enough to get them interested , then tell them more and more as the conversation continues . ”   doucette continues : “ introductions are often overlooked , but one of the three most important considerations for a piece . ”   alexander porter of searchitlocal adds : “ in 2020 , your site visitors are scanners . they skip through your content , looking for the most relevant information , and discard everything else . by focusing on the intro and conclusion , you can catch scanners and convince them that the information they seek is worth reading the full article .   “ simple ways to catch scanners include adding a tl;dr at the top of your article . this can summarise all the juiciest information and show people exactly what to expect . ”   “ if your introduction is dense and takes time to introduce your core subject , you ’ll lose readers . and these negative user signals will punish your seo efforts , ” porter summarizes .   24 . treat “ old ” blog posts as new content   “ the most important aspect of updating your old blog posts is to think of them as new blog posts , ” according to crazycall‘s jakub kliszczak .   “ this means you should n’t focus on ‘ updating them ’ per se but rather start from the position of a blank page . then keep what ’s still up - to - date , delete what ’s outdated , and add as much relevant content as you can . ”   that ’s why andrea travillian of aspirify recommends “ look at it as a full re - write . especially the older it is . ”   “ instead of just looking at the piece as needing extra pictures or examples . look at it as if you were starting from scratch today . are there sections that are no longer relevant ? are the examples outdated ? how would you write it from the ground up ? ”   25 . repromote the “ old ” blog post   while most of these tips focus on editing the post itself , elijah masek - kelly of powerful outreach says : “ i want to focus on something that you should work to do after you fully refurbish your blog posts , and that ’s making sure you spend appropriate time promoting them . ”   “ a lot of people may think that this is going to hurt them if they ’re trying to promote the same content twice , but remember , it ’s not really the same content if you refurbish it correctly . ”   “ a properly updated blog post is probably going to have new keywords , a new link profile , and most likely new added sections and text . ”   “ the only thing that really stays the same is the initial structure of the piece . so , do n’t be afraid not only to post the content on your own social but consider pitching it to industry sources as a resource they can reference . make sure to include it in guest posts that you make with other publishers as well , ” masek - kelly adds .   * editor ’s note : your job is n’t over once you finish updating the blog post itself . you need to see whether your efforts are paying off . so , grab our blog post performance after seo update dashboard template to keep an eye on how your metrics change post - update .   wrap up   updating old content is n’t as tricky as you might think .   hit pause on your publishing schedule , and set aside some time to comb through the backlog of blog posts you ’ve already got .   it ’s bound to improve the user experience and seo of your site .',\n",

              " 'scary ( but true ) small business statistics you ca n’t afford to ignore . according to the us small business administration , there are nearly 30 million small businesses in the united states employing 47.8 percent of us workers . these businesses have a big impact on the us economy through job creation and innovation .   the first part of this article includes recent market studies and small business statistics . this will provide you with an idea of what the current small business landscape looks like and help you decide on a future course of action .   in the second part of the article , we ’ll cover everything you need to know to get started with digital marketing . the internet , combined with the wide use of mobile devices , has changed the small business landscape . it ’s important to learn how to navigate this new terrain so that your business stays ahead of the pack .   small businesses in the united states   the us small business administration defines a small business as “ an organization with fewer than 500 employees . ”   the term encompasses a wide variety of business types , from freelance writers to brick - and - mortar stores , street food vendors , and growing multinational corporations .   one- and two - person teams ( known in the united states as sole proprietorships , partnerships , or non - employers ) make up a majority of small businesses .   most small businesses employ fewer than 100 employees , and in 2014 , small businesses were responsible for creating 1.4 million net new jobs .   the fast pace of technological change will continue to transform the world of work . some analysts predict that half of the workforce to be freelancers by 2020 . increasing numbers of professionals desire control over their employment , and this is contributing to freelance and small business growth .   general small business statistics   recently , small businesses have added more jobs than large businesses ( 500 + employees ) . firms with 1 - 49 employees have contributed most to this growth .   microbusinesses ( those that employ fewer than ten employees ) , despite declining in overall number since the 1970s , still make up 75.3 % of private - sector employers . these companies employ 10.5 % of all employees in the private sector .   in 2015 , businesses with less than $ 5 million in annual revenue experienced an average growth of 7.8 % in sales .   many owners are optimistic about their businesses ’ futures .   startups   startups are a subcategory of small business . ask ten people to define what a startup is , and you ’ll get ten different answers . you can think of it as a newly - formed small business that ’s designed to grow quickly .   you probably have an idea of who typically owns a startup — either the young , scrappy college grad or the mba with millions of dollars invested in silicon valley .   the reality , however , is much more expansive . startup owners span the whole gamut in age , gender , race , and other background / demographic factors :   half of small business owners are between 50 and 88 years of age .   2.5 million business owners are veterans of the armed forces .   as you can see , anyone can be an owner of a startup !   financing   to make money , you have to spend money . one source can be loans from banks .   depending on who you ask , the amount you need to start your business varies . the wells fargo small business index suggests that the average amount of startup capital is $ 10,000 , while the kauffman firm survey suggests that the average is closer to $ 80,000 . intuit , however , echoes wells fargo ’s number and has found that most of that amount is self - funded .   however , do n’t let this number deter you . small businesses , especially online businesses , might need significantly less .   online ventures may not need any outside capital . for example , writers and editors looking to get started in freelancing might not need anything but the computer they already have .   if you do find that you need financing , there are several options available to you , such as business loans and credit cards .   there are also a lot of grant opportunities , especially for those typically underrepresented in the pool of small business owners , such as women and minorities .   however , do n’t discount loans from those you know personally . and do n’t underestimate the power of sweat equity where you ’re pulling yourself up by your bootstraps .   income   the perks of owning your own small business are great : flexibility , freedom , and cultivating meaningful relationships with your clients are just a few of the perks .   however , you need to eat and have bills to pay , so at the end of the day , what will your salary look like ?   according to payscale , the median income for a small business owner is around $ 59,000 per year , with most people falling into the range of $ 26,000 to $ 153,000 .   payscale also says that geographic location has the largest influence on the owner ’s income , so those in high cost - of - living areas need not resign themselves to eating peanuts should they set out on their own .   however , owning a small business is n’t always a better option than working for someone else . working harder and earning less seems to be the norm , but keep in mind that most love what they do — 92 % do n’t regret what they ’ve done and 84 % of small business owners say that would do it again .   survival   one major fear among those looking to start a business ( and probably a nagging fear in the back of most current owners ’ minds ) is the likelihood of a business failing .   let ’s take a look at some statistics about business survival rates :   two - thirds of all businesses survive at least two years   half of all businesses survive at least five years   one - third of all businesses will survive at least ten years .   generally speaking , the longer that a business has been around , the more likely it is that it will continue to do so . the first few years seem to be the hardest .   additionally , it appears that these facts hold true regardless of which industry you ’re in .   now that we know the likelihood that a given business will survive , what are the factors that make this likelihood go down ? according to us bank , 82 % of business failures are due to issues with cash flow .   remember , this does n’t mean just money coming in vs. money going out ( though it sometimes does ) . it matters when this money comes in vs. when it needs to go out .   for example , if you typically bill users of your tax software in april , yet your web hosting bill comes due in february , you ’ll need to plan ahead for this .   there are many ways you can stay on top of challenges related to cash flow . you can hire a bookkeeper or accountant , or you can use software to keep track of things .   small businesses and the internet   the internet has changed the way business is conducted online — and offline .   think about it — do you know anyone who has never made a purchase online ? how often do you hear people talk about their online research before they purchase something ( even if they end up making the purchase in person ) ?   even if you do n’t plan on selling online , you ’ll want to have a website where people can go for information about your business .   most americans prefer to shop online , and the number is only going to get bigger as the younger generations grow up in an internet - dominated world . despite this , 46 % of small businesses do not have a website and 35 % feel that their operation is simply too small to warrant a website .   this is problematic for many reasons , especially when you consider that the two most important pieces of information a business can display are its address and other contact - related details .   as we will show , this belief goes against what the markets are saying . even the smallest of businesses can benefit from an internet presence .   however , we recognize that getting started can seem difficult . despite the benefits that come from tailoring your digital business strategy to your target audience , doing so can be like wading a minefield , in terms of cybersecurity , marketing , and overall user experience .   digital user experience   having a website is n’t enough . implementation and execution matter as well .   your customers ’ experiences with your website matter . besides having a site that works well on any device ( including smartphones ) what makes for a positive user experience ?   here are just some things to keep in mind as you create , manage , and maintain your digital presence :   ideally , your website page load time should not exceed 3 seconds — on mobile or desktop .   every second matters ; if your site does n’t load in four seconds or less , 25 % of those who navigated to your site will have left .   a person ’s first impression is formed primarily based on the design - related elements of your site , which is also what underlies a person ’s judgment on how credible you are as a business   88 % of online consumers are less likely to return to a site after a bad experience   85 % of people think that a company ’s mobile website should be as good or better than their desktop website .   57 % of users say they wo n’t recommend a business with a poorly designed mobile site   e - commerce and online shopping   most americans prefer to shop online , so it makes sense to take your business online ( even if you have a physical location ) so that you can reach as many customers as possible .   however , e - commerce has its own pitfalls , and by being aware of them , you can take action . you can minimize things like users who fail to complete transactions , despite placing items in their shopping carts , or users who put their mobile device down and forget to return to their in - progress transaction .   after all , the average shopping cart abandonment rate is 68.81 % . by tweaking checkout flow and design , sellers can recoup up to $ 260 billion worth of lost orders . it ’s also important to ensure that your store website is mobile - friendly — 58 % of mobile revenue comes from mobile websites , as opposed to native apps .   do n’t discount visitors to your site who do n’t make a purchase — these people typical hold back on online shopping due to security concerns .   regardless , 80 % of smartphone users use mobile phones for shopping research , with 88 % of all consumers referencing online reviews before making an in - person purchase .   cybersecurity and small businesses   the large corporations tend to get a lot of media attention when it comes to issues regarding cybersecurity , but it turns out that hackers , more often than not , target small businesses .   forty - three percent of cyber attacks are aimed at small businesses , and unfortunately , only 14 % are able to mitigate such risks effectively .   this is partly because major corporations , with their deep pockets , can dedicate extensive resources to cybersecurity — this is certainly an advantage that not every business , especially smaller ones , can afford .   however , some small business owners do not take cybersecurity seriously . being small is not protection against threats !   it ’s sometimes hard to quantify the impact of cybercrime since the results of these attacks range from being annoying to financially crippling .   however , symantec ( most commonly known as the makers of norton brand of security software ) and bigcommerce , an e - commerce platform , have attempted to quantify the costs of such crime .   based on their data , the cost of a data breach to an online retailer is roughly $ 172 per impacted record . it ’s no surprise that 60 % of businesses go out of business within six months of a cyber attack .   as such , cybersecurity is n’t something to be taken lightly or neglected . there are many things you can do to protect yourself . entrepreneur , hiscox , and small business trends all offer tips on keeping your site safe . ( all of these linked articles target small business owners , so the suggestions have been made with a smaller budget in mind . )   security tip : explore hackerone ’s “ bug bounty ” program . this innovative platform connects businesses with white hat hackers who work to find , document , and explain weaknesses in your website . many big and small brands are using bug bounty programs to good effect . as zdnet notes , “ everyone from porn providers to the us army uses the platform . ”   digital marketing and small businesses   question : how do you get the word out about your online business ?   answer : marketing .   however , just as the internet has changed the business landscape , the internet has changed the marketing landscape as well .   seventy - six percent of small business owners report facing marketing challenges , and with the rise of digital marketing , the field is n’t getting any less complex . digital marketing done well can give you an unfair advantage over your competition .   many small businesses currently implement and execute their own digital marketing , but given the possible returns , it might be worth it to consider hiring professional assistance .   lead generation   part of marketing is lead generation , and while this term can mean many things to many people , generally speaking , it is the process of attracting and converting prospects from those that have already expressed interested in your business .   these leads may result from direct advertising spurred by one of your initiatives , but they can also occur organically . sources of leads might include search engine results , personal referrals , telephone calls , and in - person events , such as industry - related conferences .   lead generation is n’t easy , especially since the best method is to take multiple approaches — email , social , multi - device targets , and so on .   complicating this is the fact that engaging content requires you to focus on the customer experience and to provide a personalized experience . you ca n’t send the same generic message to all parties across all channels and expect success !   one of the biggest things holding marketers back when it comes to lead generation is the lack of data . forty - two percent of marketers think that the lack of quality data is their largest obstacle when it comes to implementing successful lead generation campaigns .   this has lead to the rise of many tools designed to capture relevant data , such as new google analytics features or crms like salesforce . there are also big data professionals who aim to help you separate the signal from the noise .   finally , over 70 % of businesses that are currently using or planning to implement a marketing automation solution , which can be leveraged to carry out automated prospecting .   automated lead generation helps you generate lead data , capture contact details , and score your leads .   if the above sounds overwhelming , do n’t worry :   content is still king , and it is the fresh , customized , customer - centric content that gets the attention . those that create more of it will certainly see positive returns for their efforts . content marketing generates at least three times more leads than conventional marketing techniques .   if you sell physical products , reviews , both from third - parties and existing customers can be powerful sources of leads .   social media is still your friend , especially if you partner with a social media influencer .   mobile marketing   smartphones and tablets are ubiquitous nowadays , and more than ever , many are attached to their devices . one study found that 75 % of respondents admitted to taking their phones with them into the bathroom .   given the frequency with which people access the internet with their mobile devices ( as a matter of fact , more people access the internet via a smartphone or a tablet than using a desktop / laptop ) , it ’s obvious that mobile marketing is important if you want to reach a large portion of the population .   your specific mobile marketing strategy depends on the type of business you ’re running , who your target audience is , and whether you need just an online presence or you ’re trying to launch an online store .   at the very least , you ’ll need a website , preferably one that is responsive / mobile - friendly . however , to go above and beyond , remember that some expect mobile advertising to grow to represent 72 % of digital ad spending .   furthermore , you ’ll need to consider the nuances inherent with a mobile audience . for example , apps are important , and small businesses have responded .   nearly half of all small businesses say that they plan to launch mobile apps in spite of the high cost typically associated with app development .   finally , do n’t think that a mobile app ca n’t help your business just because you run a brick - and - mortar store . fifty - six percent of survey respondents reported visiting a brick - and - mortar store after receiving a deal or offer on their mobile device when they were near the store .   search engine marketing ( seo and ppc )   you ’ve probably heard the buzz around search engine optimization ( seo ) and pay - per - click ( ppc ) advertising .   these are basic methods by which you can boost traffic to your website . seo is the practice of building traffic for free by tweaking your website so that it ranks highly in search engine results — the higher your site is ranked , the more likely it is customers will click on the link to your site .   ppc , alternatively , is where you pay for advertising space in the sponsored results section of the search engine ’s results page .   whenever a visitor clicks through to your website , the search engine charges you a fee ( which varies based on how competitive the search term the user used is ) .   spending in search engine marketing is expected to rise to $ 45.49 billion by 2019 . what results are businesses getting ?   businesses using google adwords earn about $ 3 for every $ 1.60 spent   the first ad position on google has a click - through rate of 7.94 % .   it goes without saying that in the search engine arena , google is king ( and advertisers know this — 97 % of google ’s overall revenue comes from its adwords program ) .   on average , google processes over 40,000 search queries every second , which translates to over 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year . coming in second place is bing , which gets about 4.48 % of users .   finally , it ’s important to remember , especially those running physical storefronts , that when users use their mobile devices to search for local business information , they usually intend to make a purchase .   these searches are responsible for 300 % more traffic sent to websites than social media .   content marketing and blogging   based on spending , companies are valuing content marketing — on average , companies allocate 32 % of their total marketing budgets toward content .   b2b marketers are leading the pack , with 88 % using content marketing as part of their overall strategy .   despite the amount of money marketers are sinking into content marketing , one major they face is the increasing use of ad blockers .   this use of ad blockers has resulted in nearly $ 22 billion of lost advertising revenue . furthermore , certain types of ads are particularly ineffective — 54 % of users actively avoid banner ads , while native ads fared much better .   given these statistics , what are the alternatives ? interestingly , despite the amount spent on content marketing , only 32 % actually have a documented content marketing strategy , which means that a planned effort in this area is likely to yield higher returns . here are some methods to consider .   first , there are plenty of marketers and agency executives who see video as the next trend in content marketing . second , is a refocusing on blogging .   with all the hype surrounding social media and other digital marketing trends , do n’t forget the more humble methods of engaging with your customer base !   people love engaging with businesses in particular , and they tend to look positively on a company that releases custom content .   one easy way to do this is via blogging . remember though , that daily blogging is 25 % more effective than monthly blogging , so be sure to plan accordingly . over the long run , you can expect 87 % more inbound links , compared to companies who do n’t blog at all .   email marketing   around the world , 4.3 billion people have email . this is approximately half of the world ’s population . tackling email accounts for a lot of internet users ’ time , as we can see from the following statistics :   2.5 million emails are sent every second   on average , over 205 billion emails are sent per year   the average office worker gets 121 emails per day and spends as much as 6.3 hours each day checking his personal and business messages .   however , does quantity mean quantity , especially when we ’re considering the effectiveness of email marketing ? well , yes and no .   in general , two - thirds of all emails are ignored and never opened . when an email is opened , only 3.26 % click - through on links and follow through on the calls - to - action .   in spite of these dismal - seeming numbers , however , companies see , on average , a 4,300 % return on their investments in email marketing . b2b marketers , in particular , say that email is their top revenue - generating tool .   when communicating with consumers , remember that most prefer e - mail over all other communication channels when interacting with brands and businesses .   however , due to the skeptical nature of consumers , who think that one primary markers of a trustworthy seller is whether they have a professional email address or not , it ’s important that you maintain a professional front when sending business - related emails .   social media marketing   the sheer number of social media platforms can become overwhelming , but do n’t neglect this aspect when you design your digital marketing portfolio .   most people have at least one social media account , and one - fifth of consumers reported that they ’re influenced by social media recommendations .   in 2015 , only 13 % of small businesses reported that they use social media for communicating with customers , but given the growth in spending by small business owners in this area , it ’s clear that many are wising up to the fact that social media marketing is essential to business success .   facebook has been and continues to be the # 1 social media platform in the world with , on average , 2.01 billion monthly active users and 1.32 billion daily users .   many businesses are taking advantage of this large population of users , and in 2016 , spending on facebook accounted for 45 % of the growth in digital marketing spending .   there ’s a reason for this . with 40 million small businesses using pages on facebook , 75 % of brands using the social network to promote their posts , and 2 billion people having watched facebook live broadcasts , facebook is still the way to go if you want to connect with a large audience .   however , facebook is n’t the only social network offering great investment return potential . other popular platforms include instagram , which has 500 million active monthly users and expects to bring in $ 2.81 billion in mobile ad revenues , and twitter , where users expect to hear back from businesses within one hour , especially if their message was a complaint .   one caveat : social media has , in some ways , upped the speed of communications , so you should expect to respond and interact early and often with your followers and users .   b2b and social media   social media is still important even if you ’re engaged in b2b ( business - to - business ) marketing instead of the more traditional b2c ( business - to - consumer ) marketing . if this is your area , remember that your peers are active on social media .   the most popular option is linkedin ( especially since 80 % of all b2b social media leads come from linkedin ) , though twitter , facebook , youtube , and google+ are widely used as well .   the relationships you develop on these platforms are important : 64 % of brands report that they follow other businesses on social media .   you should also remember that :   55 % of b2b buyers search for product / vendor information on social media   75 % of b2b buyers and 84 % of executive - level personnel use social media to help make purchasing decisions .   conclusion   whether you ’re thinking about launching a small business or you own one already , these statistics can help you make better decisions and plan for growth .   technology continues to change the context that small businesses operate in . those who learn , adapt , and take advantage of these changes will thrive .   have we missed anything or do you have a suggestion to make ? let us know in the comments below !',\n",
              " '50 ways to improve on - page seo [ infographic ] . almost everything we do on a daily basis is somehow integrated with a website , an app or google search . for most companies , generating leads from google is a major source for new clients . this article will show you how to improve on - page seo on any website for any keywords in order to drive more traffic from google search results .   the biggest ranking factors that dominate the search results are the content you publish and the quality of the backlinks that point to your website . luckily for website owners , content is one of the things you have direct control over .   on - page optimization ensures your page targets the right keywords to attract the right type of traffic . you can enhance the ranking signals your site demonstrates for a specific keyword to maximize the potential your website has for generating leads .   the following infographic lists 50 different ways that your typical seo company will improve your on - page seo .   title optimization   your title is the first thing that most people will look at in a search result . include your keyword near the beginning of your title . keep the length of your title at 60 characters to avoid it being cut off in the search results .   the title is the most important heading of your page and therefore should be wrapped in h1 tags . most cms software will automatically tag the title so you do n’t need to worry about it if you ’re using wordpress , joomla , wix or squarespace .   optimize your url   the extension you give your page is an important descriptive detail for users and search engines . use the postname option in your permalink settings and make sure your url contains your keyword .   users should get a sense of what your page is about by reading the url . limit the url to five words to maximize the potency of your keyword description . ideally , your url should be kept under 90 characters to improve on - page seo .   use descriptive subtitles   use your subtitles to segment your content into the most important parts of your page . use h2 , h3 , h4 tags to signal to search engines the level of importance each heading represents .   when users scan through the page they should get an accurate summary of the content contained . what ’s good for users is good for search engines .   include your keyword and variations of your keyword at least once or more depending on the length of your article .   publish keyword - rich content for users   updates such as hummingbird and bert have allowed search engines to accurately extract the meaning from text . there is no substitute for descriptive , high - quality content . despite this fact , it is still good practice to include your keyword in the first paragraph .   it would make sense that your target keyword would be repeated in a natural , conversational tone throughout your content . your keyword should appear at least several times throughout the body of content .   avoid over - optimizing your content by keyword stuffing . any unnatural and forced use of a target keyword could trigger an adverse effect on the optimization of your page .   content that satisfies search intent will rank highly . this means that when you target a specific keyword make sure you are covering the most obvious and most searched topics and subtopics that would satisfy the user ’s query .   the goal is to make your website the last destination of a user ’s search because you have adequately answered their query .   images   despite the giant leaps forward in a search engine ’s ability to extract meaning , search engines still rely on your input to determine the meaning of an image .   use keyword - rich descriptions in the image alt tags to give search engines the intended meaning your image represents and improve your on - page seo .   include your keyword in the filename .   fill out captions and give your image an appropriate title to enhance optimization . this gives more information for search engines to properly categorize your image .   outbound links   there is much evidence to support that linking out to authority sites improves the optimization of your page . linking to a page that helps to enhance the user ’s understanding of a particular topic adds credibility and signals relevance to your keyword topic .   inbound links   the links that point to your page have a major influence on your optimization . use descriptive anchor text to influence what keywords your page best represents for contextual links .   guest posting is a popular method for optimizing the external anchor text links that point to your page .   although keyword anchor text will enhance the optimization of your page , the overuse of keyword - optimized anchor text links will have an adverse effect on your ranking .   webmasters should implement an internal linking strategy to achieve optimal on - page seo . use pillar page best practices for creating clustered content and an effective internal linking strategy .   page speed   we are well into an era where page speed can mean the difference in making a sale - or even holding a user ’s attention . do you remember the last time you waited a minute for a page to load ? neither do i. no one waits for slow websites anymore .   if your page is n’t loading in under 3 seconds you are losing a percentage of the traffic that lands on your site .   if your site is super slow , then you ’re facing a problem that is affecting your ranking because it contributes to poor user experience .   keep your images compressed , reduce the number of html requests , inline javascript and css , use plugins and cdn ’s to maintain an acceptable page load time .   proper use of redirections   whenever deleting or merging content it is advisable to use a 301 redirect to forward traffic from the old url to the new . avoid using 302 redirects as well as using redirect chains . your redirections should take a user from one url directly to the new page .   broken links   when a user clicks a link and is taken to an error message it reduces their user experience . the accumulation of broken links will adversely affect rank . all links should take a user to a destination that enhances their user experience rather than undermines it .   make site audits a regular routine to identify and repair broken links . check both inbound and outbound links using software such as ahrefs and screaming frog .   use 301 redirects for the internal links that are broken . replace all broken outbound links with new urls to authority sites .   accessible to search engines   every page on your site should be accessed in less than 4 clicks from anywhere on the site . your page should be able to be indexed by search engines , which can be impeded by the robots.txt file .   site audits will identify what pages are indexed as well as those that are not indexable . you can also find this information on google search console under the errors tab .   incorporate schema   use schema to make your page eligible for rich snippets . using schema better describes what your page is about to search engines and allows for a better understanding of the content .   using json - ld is google ’s recommended script language and accounts for faster processing .   responsive & made for mobile   your pages should be made for mobile users - especially since the mobile version is now the first version that is indexed by google .   users should experience the same functionality on different screen sizes your content should be easy to read and reformat its layout according to screen size .   check your sites mobile score on google ’s mobile friendly test and make any necessary changes listed in the report .   high - quality & shareable content   the term “ high - quality ” is a term we use a lot to describe how content should be written . the truth is that content should provide unique value and be compelling enough for users to want to share it with others .   we derive value from content that is entertaining , educational and informational . the use of images , video , audio and interactive media all contribute to a high - quality piece of content .   a high - quality web page is easily read by users at an 8th to 9th - grade reading level . the fleischman scoring system scores content based on how difficult the page is to read .   in order for content to be shared easily , there should be social sharing icons that allow users to post to the appropriate social media platform .   improve your on - page seo   there ’s no doubt that on - page seo is necessary to rank your website on the first page of google . as search engines continue to expand their capabilities , every aspect of optimizing your web page becomes less negotiable in order to maintain high rankings .   incorporate each element of on - page optimization in your content creation . create highly competitive , targeted pages that are built to last on the first page of search results .

              " \"best backlink analysis tools : side - by - side comparison [ 2020 ] . 2 the functionality of backlink analysis tools , or looking under their hood   when a company embarks on an adventure of a marketing campaign , quantity , in most cases , is regarded as a good thing . lots of traffic — good . thousands of pageviews — excellent ! the more , the merrier .   but the question is whether this abundance of traffic really converts into something meaningful . i know a lot of sites with an astronomical number of visitors that are coming from search queries irrelevant to what products or services a company offers ( you can see this very often in serp ) . realistically , it is a vanity metric that does n’t really help a company grow .   the same logic can be applied to data : quantity in itself can not drive success and profit . having trillions of data wo n’t help you advance . in fact , it ’s more likely to blur your vision and make decision - making arduous , increasing cost , and reducing efficiency .   data needs to be visualized , organized in the right order , to be easily accessible , and readable at - a - glance . to make sense of those heaps of data , you need to have the right functionality to work with it . and this is what you ’re going to learn below .   what reports and features top 6 backlink checker tools support   typically , if a tool does n’t provide the set of reports and predefined metrics , you wo n’t really know what the tool is capable of . unless you ’re a dexterous marketer by day , and a coder by night . then dealing with raw data should n’t be an issue when you ’re trying to understand a tool ’s seo plan . but the majority of marketers , including myself , prefer using tools that offer such insights in a few clicks . that ’s the real value of backlink analysis tools because they give you exactly what you ’re looking for , without the need of filtering data manually .   2.1 spammy or not : understanding the nature of a link or a domain   in this section , i put together a list of metrics that help marketers determine the trustworthiness of referring domains linked to a specific website .   in the table below , you can see the metrics that play a crucial role in differentiating quality links from spammy ones . the table shows if the tools that i analyzed include any of these metrics . below this table , i ’ll explain why i ’ve chosen these aspects as key in understanding the nature of any backlink profile .   the number of referring subnets and ips   information about the diversity of referring subnets and ips specifies if the websites linked to a certain domain are hosted on the same servers . google checks both of these metrics and penalizes those sites that have too many links coming from the same subnets or ips . to make the long story short , that ’s the very first signal to google that you ’ve built a private blog network ( pbn ) to boost your rankings .   if you spot too many links that are coming from the ip , then it ’s better to check these links and disavow them to avoid being penalized by google .   so , in ahrefs , you ’ll see the data on both referring subnets and ips on their main dashboard . if you click on each number , ahrefs will forward you to a detailed report .   in its turn , semrush does n’t show any results for referring subnets , but you can still find information about ips in a separate report tab . also , semrush provides a very informative table where you can see all the ips grouped by the number of referring domains that are associated with each ip :   speaking about majestic , so far , it wins in terms of visualization . all the numbers appear to be next to the key domain metrics and are supported by some historical data . however , the only issue with majestic ’s data visualization is that it does n’t allow you to see any description or details . what you see is just a bunch of numbers :   as for linkresearchtools , there you can find some data about referring ips . but you still need to export this data and do some magic in excel to see how many sites have the same ip .   finally , moz and cognitiveseo do n’t provide any information about these metrics .   the following two numbers are mandatory . when i evaluate the quality of a site ’s backlink profile , i always look at the ratio of domains and the total number of backlinks it has . this metric shows if the backlink profile is organic , or , in other words , is n’t comprised of spammy links .   for example , a domain has 1,000 referring domains with 100,000 backlinks . these numbers look very suspicious , so you need to stay alert to such red flags .   all tools will show the number of referring domains and backlinks on their main site ’s overview dashboard . below are a few screenshots that will give you an idea .   ahrefs ' main dashboard offers a lot of helpful of metrics :   additionally , if you open a report with all referring domains , ahrefs will let you filter out domains that have the largest number of backlinks . you can then export them into a file and manually check if any of them are toxic .   unlike ahrefs , semrush offers a different kind of visualization :   despite its contrasting look , semrush ’s functionality , akin to the other tools , allows users to see which referring domains have the highest number of backlinks :   majestic , on the other hand , loses to its opponents in data visualization , making its dashboard hard to read . the biggest disadvantage i find is that you ca n’t simply take a screenshot and incorporate it into your client ’s presentation because of how the data appears on the dashboard :   in moz , you ’ll also find more information such as inbound links and ranking keywords to help with your link - building strategy on their site ’s overview dashboard :   cognitiveseo ’s main dashboard also provides quite a solid overview of a site ’s backlink profile to a user . it allows you to review the number of referring domains and backlinks that a particular site has :   the only thing is that some of these graphs are missing important data descriptions , like the graph that shows a pie chart with link profile influence . and i ’m not sure what the different colors mean besides the purple and green ones that you can see in the legend of a graph .   as for linkresearchtools , it also shows the number of referring domains as well as the website backlinks that you want to analyze :   to sum up — all the tools provide the data on the ratio of referring domains vs. backlinks . so , regardless of the solution you choose , you will have this data at hand to check this ratio for any website . it will help you filter out spam sites and make sure that your link building strategy only focuses on acquiring links on meaningful sites .   graphs with historical growth of links   tracking the historical growth of links is another metric i always keep in mind when auditing backlink profiles . backlink history shows how many links crawlers have found to a given web page in the past . the chart indicates backlink growth associated with a specific domain , and it should n’t go up or down , which might be a sign that a site is using manipulative strategies to get backlinks .   below , you can see the graphs from ahrefs that show the historical growth of the number of referring domains and pages to help you monitor the process of acquiring links :   in its turn , majestic offers data for the current year only , but you can still take advantage of it . to get the most relevant and accurate information about the historical growth , you need to select the cumulative mode from the drop - down menu :   as for semrush , it will show you only the historical data about your backlinks growth on their main dashboard . also , you can select whether you want to see only new backlinks or also the lost ones :   when it comes to historical data , moz lets you choose between the number of linked domains and changes that happened to the authority level over time for the domain or page you ’re analyzing . the only downside is that the graph shows data for a very limited timeframe :   on the cognitiveseo ’s dashboard , you can find a chart with the historical growth of backlinks that allow you to choose between cumulative and monthly view mode , as well as between backlinks and referring domains :   finally , linkresearchtools does n’t provide any data that will visualize the historical changes of the backlink profile .   2.1 understanding the general quality score of a backlink profile   now , let ’s take a look at the table below . on it , you can see the metrics that will assist you in finding the general quality score of any domain or link . ideally , you need to gather information about all of these metrics to ensure that you ’re not making any headstrong conclusions :   ctlds distribution   most tools that we ’re reviewing in this post show ctlds distribution visualized as a map on the main dashboard . this data is based on country code top - level domain ( cctld ) , which is an internet top - level domain generally used or reserved for a country , a sovereign state , or a dependent territory .   we ’ll start with ahrefs . here ’s how its dashboard displays this data :   and this is what the looks like in semrush :   in cognitiveseo , you need to click on the tab « referring domains » do get access to the ctld distribution graph :   as for linkresearchtools , it provides a very in - depth report that allows selecting between tabs to check different groups of links :   unfortunately , majestic and moz do n’t have any data for the internet domain extension .   number of .gov and .edu referring domains   another important metric is the number of .gov and .edu referring domains . this metric adds to the domain ’s trustworthiness and credibility level . such sites will never refer to a spammy website in the first place unless they are hacked , but that ’s the whole other story .   i ’m not going to add any screenshots here because ahrefs , semrush , cognitiveseo , and majestic all have these domains in their main site ’s overview dashboards . all of them also support more detailed reports on that matter . the only tool that does n’t show the number of .gov and .edu referring sites is linkresearchtools .   types of backlinks   some people say that there ’s not much difference between the link that ’s coming from an image and the one that ’s inserted within a text .   for the most part , it ’s true . but the links that are allocated in the text are much more powerful since they have more chances to pass more link equity to your page .   regardless of your belief , the tool that you ’re using should show you the domain ’s distribution links by their type , which can be especially handy when you are analyzing competitors ' backlinks .   so , let ’s take a look at how each of the tools under consideration presents the breakdown of the backlink types .   ahrefs shows this metric on its main dashboard . however , you can only see the number of links that come from images , and you ca n’t see the list of pages these links are coming from . when it comes to links that are coming from redirects , you can get this data from the backlink report :   in its turn , majestic not only represents a graph with the types of links but also allows a user to browse through pages that are linking to your images :   semrush , thanks to its diverse functionality , offers you to check every type of backlinks :   as for linkresearchtools , it has a nice dashboard that allows you to see different types of links and check out which links belong to each type :   finally , moz and cognitiveseo do n’t provide any information about the types of links .   distribution of anchor texts   in my opinion , anchor text distribution is one of the most important features that gives you an idea about how natural the backlink profile of any site is . sometimes , by looking at what kind of anchor texts a domain or a page has , you can easily track down suspicious activities related to a site ’s link acquisition strategy .   so far , ahrefs has been my favorite in terms of visualization of an anchor cloud :   semrush ’s graph looks similar to ahrefs ' table , and it also includes anchor terms :   majestic decided to go a different way and added a chart to make this information more visually appealing :   as for moz , it offers some insights into the anchor cloud in the following table :   on an image below , you can find how cognitiveseo showcases the distribution of anchors :   finally , here ’s the graph where you can see the most commonly used anchor texts from linkresearchtools . probably , this is the most in - depth report about anchor text that i ’ve ever seen in my life as it allows you to select a particular type of links and analyze anchor text across the predefined group :\",\n",

              " 'mipa - dkim .    home deployment ietf wg faq mipa dkim frequently asked questions   send suggestions and corrections to :   version : 16 - oct-2007 10:32send suggestions and corrections to : dave crocker   this list will continue to change , as you ask new and interesting questions and as better answers are developed . basics   implementation   adoption and deployment   technical details   comparison with related technologies basics   what is the purpose of dkim ? dkim allows an organization to take responsibility for transmitting a message , in a way that can be verified by a recipient . the organization can be the author \\'s , the originating sending site , an intermediary , or one of their agents . their reputation is the basis for evaluating whether to trust the message for delivery . what does dkim do ? the responsible organization adds a digital signature to the message , associating it with a domain name of that organization . typically , signing will be done by an service agent within the authority of the message originator \\'s administrative management domain ( admd ) . signing might be performed by any of the functional components , in that environment , including : mail user agent ( mua ) , or mail submission agent ( msa ) , internet boundary mta . dkim permits signing to be performed by authorized third - parties . who validates the signature ? after a message has been signed , any agent in the message transit path can choose to validate the signature . typically , validation will be done by an agent in the admd of the message recipient . again , this may be done by any functional component within that environment . notably this means that the signature can be used by the recipient admd \\'s filtering software , rather than requiring the recipient end - user to make an assessment . what does a dkim signature mean ? the owner of the domain name being used for a dkim signature is declaring that they are accountable for the message . this means that their reputation is at stake . receivers who successfully validate a signature can use information about the signer as part of a program to limit spam , spoofing , phishing , or other undesirable behavior , although the dkim specification itself does not prescribe any specific actions by the recipient . note : an interesting example of signature use is to detect email that purports to be from a user of the receiving site . if that site signs all its email , then incoming mail that purports to be from one of the site \\'s users , but is not signed , is not valid . will using dkim improve my deliverability and guarantee that my marketing mail goes directly to the recipients \\' inbox , bypassing any spam filters ? whether this improves deliverability or bypasses filters is entirely at the discretion of the validating receivers . when a message has been signed using dkim , a receiver uses their knowledge about the signer to determine the most appropriate treatment of the message . it is expected that messages from a signer who has a good reputation will be subject to less scrutiny by the receiver \\'s filters . what does dkim not do ? examples include : dkim does not offer any assertions about the behaviors of the identity doing the signing .   dkim does not prescribe any specific actions for receivers to take upon successful ( or unsuccessful ) signature validation .   dkim does not provide protection after message delivery .   dkim does not protect against re - sending ( replay of ) a message that already has a valid signature ; therefore a transit intermediary or a recipient can re - post the message in such a way that the signature would remain valid , although the new recipient(s ) would not have been specified by the originator . s / mime and openpgp also do email digital signing . why not simply use one of them ? unlike other mechanisms , dkim satisfies the short - term needs of email transit authentication . this make it less costly to use . it also can be entirely invisible to end - users whose software does not support dkim , whereas s / mime and openpgp are quite intrusive . ( an extended discussion of technical differences is in the comparisons section , below . ) dkim is claimed to be an upgrade of yahoo \\'s domainkeys . what is different and why should i upgrade ? dkim is the result of a multi - company effort to enhance domainkeys for broader adoption , better security , and more flexibility . note : dkim is upward compatible with existing domainkeys dns records , so that a dkim module does not automatically require additional dns administration ! a lengthy list of the technical differences is in the comparisons section , below . what is dkim \\'s history ? dkim was produced by an industry consortium in 2004 . it merged and enhanced domainkeys , from yahoo ! and identified internet mail , from cisco . the resulting specification is in production use . an ietf working group has standardized and refined dkim . implementation   what software has to change , to use dkim ? the signer needs to add code in the appropriate agent , to perform signing , and they need to modify their dns administrative tools to permit creation of dkim key records . a validator needs to add code to the appropriate agent and then feed the result into the portion of their system needing it , such as a filtering engine . the mere existence of a valid signature does not imply that the mail is acceptable , such as for delivery . acceptability requires an assessment phase . hence the result of signature validation must be fed into a vetting mechanism that is part of the validator \\'s filter . back to top adoption and deployment   when should i consider deploying dkim ? dkim is ready for use today . there already are multiple implementations , including some that are open source , and it is in production operation . note : dkim can provide a significant benefit to each site that implements it , independent of implementation by any other site . when a site begins signing all mail , it can immediately detect any incoming email that purports to have originated from that site , but is not signed and is therefore not valid . that can effectively eliminate substantial amounts of spam and phishing that is based on the addresses of users at the site . please see the deployment page . when will the service providers start using dkim ? some already are . dkim permits incremental adoption and use , so that benefit can accrue quickly ; they increase as more sites start using it . back to top technical details   what is a technical summary of the way dkim works ? dkim defines an authentication mechanism for email , using : a domain name identifier   public - key cryptography   a dns - based public key publishing service . an agent in the message transit path can sign the message content and selected header fields . the signature information is placed into a field of the rfc2822 message header . validation of the signature , by a later agent in the path , demonstrates that the signing identity took responsibility for the message . there also are mechanisms for listing formal assertions about the signature or the message . this publicly registers the signing organization \\'s message signing practices . what are dkim \\'s technical goals ? low implementation and operations costs ( avoid large pki , new internet services )   no trusted third parties required ( e.g. , key servers )   no client or recipient user agent upgrades required   no changes for end users required   validate message itself ( not just its path )   allow delegation of signing authority ( e.g. , for outsourcing )   extensible ( key service , hash , public key )   structure usable for per - user sign - in what is a dkim \" selector \" ? a selector is added to the domain name , used to find dkim public key information . it is specified as an attribute for a dkim signature , and is recorded in the dkim - signature header field . validation uses the selector as an additional name component , to give differential dns query names . there are different dkim dns records associated with different selectors , under the same domain name . for example : jun2005.eng._domainkey.example.com hence , selectors are used to permit multiple keys under the same organization \\'s domain name . this can be used to give separate signatory controls among departments , date ranges , or third parties acting on behalf of the domain name owner .. how is a dkim signature recorded in a message a dkim signature is recorded as an rfc2822 header field for the signed message . for example : dkim - signature a = rsa - sha1 ; q = dns ;   d = example.com ;   i=user@eng.example.com ;   s = jun2005.eng ; c = relaxed / simple ;   t=1117574938 ; x=1118006938 ;   h = from : to : subject : date ;   b = dzdvyofakcdlxdjoc9g2q8loxslenisb   av+yuu4zgeerud00lszzvog4zhrniyzr back to top comparison with related technologies   since uses technology that is similar to s / mime and openpgp , to sign a message , why not one of these earlier methods ? they already are ietf standards . dkim is based on domain names , rather than complete email addresses . hence , signing is controlled by the administrator of the domain name , rather than by individual email users . dkim uses dns - based self - certified keys . because the scope of dkim is limited , it does not need generalized , powerful and long - term certificates , issued by separate authorities . s / mime and openpgp are intended for longer - term , personal protection and therefore use costlier mechanisms and per - user identification , with the requirement that key and certification information , needed for a given message , be available essentially forever . also they require modification of the message body , to provide their packaging as mime body - part types . dkim does not modify the body . rather it places its parametric information into header fields that are typically not shown to the recipient . therefore dkim \\'s can be entirely invisible to recipients . using domain names , rather than email addresses , provides particular advantages , as discussed in crypto and spam . what are the differences between domainkeys ( dk ) and dkim dkim has enhanced the dk dns key record , to permit the addition of several parameters . dkim permits the signing identity to be different from the identities used for the author or the initial posting agent . this is essential , for example , to enable support of signing by authorized third - parties , and to permit signatures by email providers who are otherwise independent of the domain name of the message author . dkim permits restricting the use of a signature key to particular types of services , such as only for email . this is helpful when delegating signing authority , such as to a particular department or to a third - party outsourcing service . dkim self - signs the dkim - signature header field , to protect against its being modified . in order to survive the vagaries of different email transfer systems , mechanisms like dkim must evaluate the message data in some canonical form , such as treating a string of spaces as tabs as if they were a single space . dkim has added the \" relaxed \" canonicalization in place of \" nofws \" . domainkeys has a parameter that allows restricting use of a signature key to a specific user mailbox value , such as mailbox@example.com . dkim enhances this to permit specifying a portion of the mailbox string as a wildcard , such as\"mailbox+ * \" . this is useful to handle the unofficial practice of \" sub - addressing \" such as for distinguishing among a user \\'s different categories of email exchange . with dkim the signer must explicitly list the headers that are signed . this is an improvement because it requires the signer to use the more conservative ( likely to verify correctly ) mechanism and makes it considerably more robust against the handling of intermediary mtas . dkim supports signature timeouts . hence a signature can explicitly declare how long the dns must be able to satisfy queries about the signature key . dkim includes language to make it clear which particular header field is signed , if there is more than one header field of a given name in the message . dkim allows body length limits , to permit signatures , to survive transit through some intermediaries , such as some mailing list agents that add text to the end of the message . more dkim / domainkeys differences : dkim uses a different rfc2822 header field for storing the signature , in order to distinguish it from dk . dkim has split header and body canonicalization . dkim allows multi - character tag names . dkim does not support the domainkey - x509 : header . dkim has divided the signing policy into a separate document , which will probably differ from that of domainkeys . dkim allows some values that were scalars in domainkeys to be colon - separated arrays . for example , the list of query methods used to find a key and the \" t= \" tags ( originally testing , now flags ) . dkim permits copying the original version of headers fields and their values , to aid in diagnosing signatures that do not survive transit . dkim has the ability to limit keys to hash algorithms specified in a list , in the dns record   back to top comments concerning this site should be sent to : webmaster@mipassoc.org',\n",

  storage capacity   make sure your email service provider is able to store your files with plenty of room . mailchimp offers unlimited storage as long as the images and other files are under 10 mb each .   bounce management   there are two categories of emails that “ bounce ” back to you as a sender . “ hard bounces ” are emails that absolutely can not be delivered . this could be because the email address was input incorrectly or the recipient ’s email server has blocked delivery . when your email service provider detects a hard bounce the email address should be removed from your subscriber list .   the second category is called a “ soft bounce . ” a soft bounce means that the email was not delivered … but could possibly be . reasons for soft bounces could be that the email server is down for the recipient , the mailbox is full , or several other technical reasons on the recipient ’s end . your esp should recognize a soft bounce and take note . if several soft bounces occur over and over again , that address should be removed from your subscriber list .   spam design and testing   some email service providers provide spam testing to rate how likely your email is to go to spam . it runs your email through popular spam filters before sending it to detect anything that could flag your content as spam .   send time optimization   this feature is part of mailchimp and may not be available with all their plans and may not be an option with other email service providers but we find it of great value . send time optimization allows you to send your email but it will be delivered at the optimal time for the subscriber to receive it . once you hit send , mailchimp will send your email within 24 hours based on data gathered from the subscribers ’ previous open rates . for more information on this feature visit using send time optimization .   a / b testing   this feature can be used to try out different factors to see which ones get the most opens . we ’ve used this to test a person ’s name for instance versus the company ’s name . we ’ll send the email to a random group of people with it one way ( group a ) , and the other random group another way ( group b ) . after a set amount of time , the winner between the two groups will be sent to the rest of the group .   growing your email subscriber list   once you have your email service provider ready it is time to grow your subscriber list . do n’t become complacent in regard to growing your subscriber base . people change jobs which means they lose a contact , they unsubscribe , or they change email addresses . if you are not actively growing your list of subscribers , it will degrade over time . it is helpful before beginning to grow your subscriber list to consider the goals of your email marketing . to help create clear and concise goals for your email marketing efforts , check out our blog post digital marketing goals for email marketing .   some best practices for growing your email subscriber list :   make sure that your audience has an easy way to sign up for your emails on your website . while it is tempting to gather as much information on this form as possible . limit it to 2 - 3 fields .   hosting an event ? be sure to include a field for email when they register . brian shared this tip and some other great details in his blog 3 tips for growing your email marketing database .   create unique engaging content and encourage your current subscribers to email and share with others . create a hyperlink “ share with a friend ” so that they can easily forward the link for others to read and with your clear call to action at the bottom on how to subscribe , you can gain new subscribers .   do you have an existing but older list already ? create an opt - in email giving these older emails the choice to sign back up or to decline . the key here is to give them the option but also promise them that if they do not respond you will remove them from the list . be sure your wording is delicate and not a command but instead reads more of a genuine “ hey - i’d love to connect with you but understand if you are not interested and i will respect your time . ”   add an opt - in hyperlink to your email signatures . if they are already communicating with customers and potential customers , make it as easy as possible for someone to sign up .   make a gated offer . a gated offer is the exchange of information . the user will give their email address in exchange for a discount code , downloadable pdf , or other files , or to sign up for a free webinar . if the content you are offering is of value to them , they will give their email address in exchange for it .   blog and guest blog . we are huge proponents of blogging at dogwood .

              " 'what is ecommerce ? definitions , examples , and the origin of online shopping . ecommerce stands for electronic commerce and refers to a digital platform and a business model where you can buy or sell products online . every time you purchase a product online , you ’re participating in the ecommerce economy .   the term is quite broad and flexible , as it not only includes amazon or ebay , but online banking , software services , remote service providers , or online course platforms ( basically , any transaction made online ) . however , depending on the context , the term “ ecommerce ” is often used to refer to the typical online store that sells shirts to end consumers .   examples :   “ over the years , ecommerce businesses are growing and becoming more common than ever . ”   “ i wanted to build a saas first , but instead , i think i ’m going to open an ecommerce site to sell pizza ingredients . ”   ecommerce definitions   as said before , ecommerce is a broad and flexible term . this means there ’s no consensus on what it means exactly or what counts as an “ ecommerce business ” or not .   so let ’s start by exploring different definitions . first , there ’s the definition you get when googling “ what ’s ecommerce , ” where it simply refers to any transaction made on the internet :   then , if you look at investopedia , their definition seems to refer to a “ business model ” that allows online transactions to happen from any device . so it ’s not only a type of transaction but a type of business :   as for amazon ’s definition , ecommerce is a brick - and - mortar store transformed into online storefronts to trade goods and services over the internet . it specifies that it can be either a business model or a distribution channel , depending on its strategy . as it is what allows businesses to reach customers worldwide .   but does an exact definition matter ? according to alexander graf and holger schneider in their ecommerce book , ecommerce ’s definition has been pretty unclear , stating that :   what happens ( with ecommerce ) is that when people try to adapt a definition to their role , their company , or their overall professional environment , they find it hard to describe precisely what has changed as against the situation ten years ago . e - commerce seems to be everywhere , in every process , channel , and tool . alexander graf & holger schneider   yet , people seem to be using the term every day and making buzzwords off of it . explaining that :   over the last decade , words like ‘ multichannel ecommerce ’ or ‘ omnichannel commerce ’ have emerged to back up questionable strategies ( … ) the result is little more than new buzzwords to describe failing approaches . even as e - commerce experts , though , we have trouble formulating an exact definition of this term . alexander graf & holger schneider   so if ecommerce experts ca n’t formulate an exact definition , what should you settle for ? maybe , you should keep it simple and stay with the first sentence of this article as your official definition .   difference between ecommerce and e - business   by its definition , it might sound like ecommerce involves every business transaction made online — but that ’s not necessarily true .   ecommerce is a subset of e - business . it covers particularly the sales and purchases made on the internet — while e - business involves any online business activity , including sales calls , procurement of materials , signing contracts , and so on .   an ecommerce business only requires a website as its only platform in order to work . in contrast , an e - business might require customer relationship management ( crm ) , a digital workplace , and enterprise resource planning ( erp ) in order to run .   for example , “ ecommerce ” is more appropriate to use when referring to an online store that sells physical products to the internet user , as there ’s no touch between you and the customer and the whole sales process happens online .   on the other hand , an e - business often refers to a b2b consultancy agency that receives inquiries from potential clients . there , the sales process is more complex and requires introductions , sales calls , a proposal , and an onboarding process in order to work . so the actual “ transaction ” is only one part of the business operation .   why ecommerce is so important and talked about : the stats   the simple ability to make purchases online has changed our lives forever . and despite having unclear definitions , ecommerce is here to stay .   the ecommerce industry is growing exponentially , more ecommerce businesses are emerging , and the digital economy is continuously expanding while reaching every corner of the world that has internet access .   if you ’re still skeptical about the impact of the ecommerce industry , here ’s some data :   by january of 2022 , there were around 4.95 billion internet users worldwide , which is 62.5 % of the global population ( while the urbanization rate is 57 % ) .   in 2021 , retail ecommerce sales amounted to 4.9 trillion u.s dollars worldwide . and it ’s forecast to grow over 50 % within the next four years . people are buying products online , and they ’ll only buy more .   google reports that more than 80 % of customers conduct their research online before making a purchase decision . which means most of google searches are made with a purchase intention .   in 2021 , $ 3.56 trillion in retail sales were made from mobile devices . ecommerce businesses have been optimizing for mobile commerce for several years .   more ecommerce statistics .   we ’re living in an era where there ’s more people with a smartphone than people living in urban areas , and where the internet has developed strong roots in your personal life .   this means , ecommerce is an industry that ’s reaching almost any person in the world with internet access — offering both conveniences to buy products and opportunities to start a business .   the origin of ecommerce and its evolution   the first ecommerce transaction was made in 1994 . phil brandenberger used his mastercard to buy sting ’s ten summoners ’ tales via the internet for $ 12.48 . this particular transaction made history and signaled to the world that the “ internet is open ” for ecommerce transactions .   why ? because it was the first time that encryption technology was used to enable an internet purchase .   since then , ecommerce has grown by leaps and bounds .   the rise of ecommerce giants like amazon and alibaba in the mid -1990s changed the face of the retail industry . they essentially capitalized on the global internet penetration and digitalization of the financial system , which contributed to the decline in retail sales for many brick - and - mortar stores .   after that , google ’s growth and its massive traffic made it possible for business owners to pay for ads , do performance - based marketing with more data than ever , and attract customers organically through search engine optimization ( seo ) to make their websites rank for high - valuable keywords .   plus , the rise of social media brought the attention of business owners , too , replicating the same phenomenon as google but with a social layer and making the online experience more interactive and targeted .   ecommerce has also impacted the retail workforce . the u.s bureau of labour statistics ( bls ) has revealed that from 1997 to 2016 , employment in the ecommerce sector increased by 80 % . and today , in 2022 , there are already 787,104 u.s employees in the ecommerce space .   today , anyone can start an ecommerce business from scratch using platforms like shopify or bigcommerce without coding or having any technical skills at all . and if you know how to code , there are plenty of open - source platforms you can use to build any business you want .   in the future , ecommerce might simply become “ commerce ” once it becomes the default method to buy groceries for your home — offline commerce will become a different but just optional experience .   types of ecommerce businesses   you can categorize ecommerce businesses according to the products or services that they sell , the parties they transact with , or even the platforms on which they operate .   we ’ll look at all three aspects to give you a clear picture of the types of ecommerce sites out there .   classifying ecommerce according to “ who ” is selling   looking at the parties participating in the e - commerce transaction is another way in which ecommerce sites can be classified . these typically include :   1 . business to consumer ( b2c )   as the name suggests , the b2c model represents a business that sells products or services to individual consumers . b2c ecommerce is the most common business model among both physical and online retailers , as the number of potential customers is larger and scalability is higher .   an example of a b2c business is cocokind . a b2c ecommerce brand that sells skin care products online to the people who are going to use them . thus , you can see them enhancing their customer experience with quizzes , routine builders , and blogs to incentivize their target audience to purchase their products for personal use .   2 . direct to consumer ( d2c )   the popular d2c brands are those businesses that sell products to customers and also manufacture it — cutting out intermediaries within the brand and the end consumer .   the key here is that these brands can interact and build relationships with the people who are using their products , get feedback , build an audience , and make shipping more efficient .   joi is an excellent example since they offer a “ unique ” product for making plant - based milk that is n’t 98 % water .   instead of recurring to intermediaries or amazon to sell their product , joi builds its brand and owns its distribution so they can sell directly to the people they ’re trying to help in the first place .   and if you take a look at their website , you ’ll notice that they ’ve built a very particular brand that no intermediary would ’ve ever done justice to .   3 . business to business ( b2b )   in the b2b model , both parties involved are businesses . here , one company provides the other with products or services .   b2b companies are often service - based or software companies ( and they ’d simply be referred to as “ agencies ” or “ saas , ” respectively ) . b2b businesses that sell products also exist , and they ’re often vendors or manufacturers selling to retail stores or manufacturers — depending on their place in the productive chain .   a simple example is avery dennison ’s store . it sells labelers and attachers for business customers who are often packaging stuff . its catalog is extensive enough to cover everything you might need as a busy retailer .   4 . consumer to business ( c2b )   the c2b business model represents a transaction in which individuals create value for businesses . unlike the traditional business - to - consumer model , consumers provide companies with products or services , co - operate on projects , and ultimately help companies increase their profits .   shutterstock comes to mind as a great c2b example . it allows professional photographers to sell royalty - free photos that businesses might use for their marketing efforts .   this model allows regular individuals to make money by helping businesses with high - quality media that might result in greater productivity .   5 . consumer to consumer ( c2c )   c2c ecommerce happens when the two parties involved are consumers that trade with one another . they typically are marketplace platforms where individuals can communicate and agree on deals with each other .   ebay and craiglist are the most basic examples , as their platforms allow any individual to sell or buy anything to anyone in the world in one place without having to purchase from a business .   classifying ecommerce businesses according to “ what ” they sell   now , let ’s go over “ what ” and “ how ” ecommerce businesses can sell online . and these include :   1 . retailers selling physical goods   these are your typical online retailers selling clothing , furniture , tools , and accessories . shoppers can buy a physical product through online stores by visiting the stores ’ websites , adding items to their shopping cart , and checkout .   most of these are b2c or d2c brands selling products . but they can also be b2b vendors .   a good example is h&m ’s ecommerce store and the clothes they sell on their website . they ’re entirely focused on attracting customers to add products to their cart and make a purchase .   h&m owns multiple physical stores throughout the world , but their website allows anyone to buy from them without problems .   2 . service - based businesses   you can also purchase services online . and they can include people who offer specialized services to businesses , such as freelancers , agencies , and consultants .   due to how services can vary , the buying process for services depends on the merchant . depending on the service , some may allow you to purchase their services straightaway from their website , or require you to get in touch with them first ( i.e. , book a consultation ) to determine your needs .   most service - based businesses are b2b , offering specialized marketing , coding , or design work for other brands , such as contently , as it offers content marketing for your business and has its own platform for the payments , the onboarding , and so on .   digital b2c services still exist too . if you go to fiverr , you ’ll find people offering all kinds of services , going from the most professional side , such as relationship therapy , to the most mundane , like coaching for online games like league of legends .   3 . digital products   digital products refer to all items that are in a digital format , including ebooks , online courses , graphics , and virtual goods . businesses selling these types of products fall into this category .   course marketplaces , niche sites with info products , or premium newsletters are among the businesses selling digital products . they offer a product that does n’t require shipping , and they can scale without stock limitations .   skillshare is a course marketplace , for example . and it offers a tremendous amount of educational courses for learning any skill you want , including cooking , carpentry , and even public speaking .   skillshare is catered toward the general public ( b2c ) , so its pricing and platform are set for anyone to use it — like netflix for courses .   4 . wholesale vendors   these are businesses that sell products in bulk . often , to retailers who sell them to the end consumer . you could categorize them as b2b ecommerce since they sell products to businesses , but their role is simply to act as vendors for the brands who put those products on the market .   alibaba , for example , is a classic ecommerce wholesale vendor . they provide products from chinese suppliers to thousands of ecommerce stores selling products through dropshipping — and they only need to order products from their website .   5 . dropshipping   dropshipping is a sale method where the retailer sells a product online , and the supplier handles the shipping . therefore , a dropshipping business is an online store where you only need to take care of the online sales and not worry about logistics or inventory management .   it ’s not surprising that this method is trendy due to how accessible it is to build an ecommerce business this way . dropshipping apps like oberlo and aliexpress make it as easy as installing an app .   there are thousands of online stores doing dropshipping . warmly , for example , simply sells home decor .   its website is a pretty organized catalog of domestic products you can buy , and the fact that they ’re a dropshipping store means that they do n’t manufacture those products — they only sell them .   6 . crowdfunding   crowdfunding is the collection of money from potential consumers to help bring a product to the market . they ’re often businesses that facilitate businesses to raise funds for their projects .   what ’s interesting about crowdfunding is that the upfront money allows the business owners to develop the product under specific conditions given by their audience — building some sort of relationship right away without making the first transaction .   a popular crowdfunding platform is kickstarter , where you can either make your ideas public or invest in the development of other products . thanks to this platform , multiple businesses have risen as this platform makes it easy to publish an idea or donate .   7 . subscription - based businesses   these are businesses that “ rent ” online services for a monthly price .   most of the time , these are software - as - a - service businesses ( saas ) that offer access to a software product for a recurrent payment — often with a variety of subscription plans and different price ranges .   the saas industry has its own world and best practices , such as freemium plans , free trials , onboarding processes — so it is a very different business model from an online store that sells t - shirts .   hubspot is the typical example of a subscription - based business . its main product is a crm for sales teams , but it also offers plenty of marketing features for email marketing , seo , blogging , etc .   they have a basic free plan for people who need a simple crm . however , once you start growing and requiring more capacity / features , you ’ll have to upgrade your plan and start paying a subscription to use the software in full .   note : saas is n’t the only type of subscription - based business . other businesses that offer premium newsletters , access to premium communities , or courses can also fall into this category .   the platforms where ecommerce is taking place   now that you know the types of ecommerce businesses in the market right now . let ’s go over the platforms where these businesses are taking place .   1 . online store websites   the first place where businesses are doing business is on their own website . using shopping carts and ecommerce platforms , retailers build online stores where they showcase their products and services .   thankfully , today you do n’t need technical skills nor hire a web developer to build a website — for there are plenty of ecommerce platforms that do it for you .   below are listed the most relevant ecommerce solutions currently on the market .   shopify   shopify powers over 3,766,071 websites around the globe , and owns over 32 % of the ecommerce platform ’s market share .   this platform is very popular among beginners and small businesses since shopify allows you to launch effective online stores over the weekend . with a user -

in seo features , and is fully hosted . and from their app store , you can install numerous third - party apps to complement your business .   shopify is best for : small businesses looking for an all - in - one ecommerce solution . if you think it ’s not the right platform , you can always try other shopify alternatives .   magento   to date , magento has powered over 772,000 websites around the world .   magento is a highly flexible ecommerce solution used by medium to big businesses ready to scale . this platform offers robust features to customize all aspects of your online store , including custom templates , modules , and automation rules .   if you need to extend the features of your magento store further , you can always use one of the 5,900 extensions available in the extension store to turn your vision into a reality .   considered as a complex ecommerce platform , magento also supports you by maintaining an operative community of developers and experts on the magento ecosystem who are ready to help you , whether you use the enterprise plan or the open -

source ecommerce platforms , and it ’s specifically designed to integrate with wordpress .   woocommerce has plenty of templates that can help you build a unique online store . you ’ll get all essential features , including unlimited products , unrestricted customization , order management , and free shipping — and since it ’s open - source , you can always personalize the platforms to your liking if you know how to code .   woocommerce is best for : small businesses with a wordpress website and users familiar with it .   carrd   carrd is not a platform built to create an ecommerce website , as it ’s made for simplicity and to build one - page sites .   this platform is the cheapest way for freelancer portfolios or handcrafters selling their work . it ’s made for individuals who want a quick , easy business to run . and the reason it ’s relevant is due to the segment it covers in the digital industry , powering over 800,000 websites right now .   carrd is best for : individual freelancers or one - person businesses selling one service or few products .   2 . product marketplaces   online marketplaces facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers , enabling sellers to showcase their products and reach a larger audience . these platforms are popular among customers because of their wide selection of products and services from different sellers and providers all around the globe .   in an online marketplace , you ’re no longer purchasing from the brand ’s website . instead , you ’re buying from a retailer who ’s simply reselling products online . some of those marketplaces include :   amazon   a company that needs no introduction , amazon is the largest ecommerce seller in the united states , with a revenue of $ 469.8 billion in 2021 . the ecommerce giant has around 200 million us - based amazon prime members worldwide who , on average , spend $ 1,400 a year on online purchases .   amazon is one of the biggest online marketplaces in the world . it offers customers a wide selection of products from retailers around the globe and enables businesses to reach a large audience on its platform .   ebay   ebay has a total of 1.5 billion products listed on their platform and around 147 million active buyers in 2021 — impacting the ecommerce industry significantly .   connecting retailers and customers from all around the globe , ebay is an online marketplace that can help small and medium - sized businesses establish an international customer base .   ebay is user - friendly , intuitive , and offers several payment options , so almost anyone can buy or sell on their platform . plus , it has a unique feature that allows merchants to host online auctions and make the market more interactive .   etsy   etsy had 2.7 million active sellers and 45.7 active online buyers in 2020 , plus 60 million items listed for sale .   etsy is the perfect platform for creatives looking for an online marketplace to showcase their unique handmade products . it ’s particularly popular among independent creatives and people looking to buy one - of - a - kind , exclusive , and rare items .   handcrafters and artists come here to put their unique work on sale . and surprisingly , a lot of people are willing to pay good money for them — as etsy ’s platform makes it easy to both sell and buy this kind of goods .   alibaba   alibaba had 1.24 billion customers in 2021 and $ 109.48 billion in revenue in 2021 . it is a marketplace where retailers can get products from their suppliers .   alibaba is one of the biggest online marketplaces in the world . as mentioned before , this platform is particularly effective for reaching big manufacturers and purchasing products in bulk . alibaba dominated the chinese market , too , with an estimated 960 million active customers .   3 . social media marketplaces   there are around 4.62 billion users of social media in the world .   over the last years , social media platforms — particularly facebook , instagram , and pinterest — have started to make it easier for brands to reach and get customers .   despite social media platforms making it harder to get traffic from them , they ’re instead allowing brands to sell products directly from their platform .   for example , retailers that showcase their products on instagram can use instagram ’s checkout option — enabling customers to purchase the items they like without leaving instagram .   ecommerce companies can also use instagram shoppable stories , which allows businesses to add product stickers on a story . so customers that come across a product they like can simply click on a sticker to start the checkout process .   facebook is on this train as well , as its marketplace has been a famous place to sell and buy products for several years . but more than that , you can now launch a facebook shop that integrates with your instagram account .   pinterest is another social marketplace , as you can sell products with pinterest shopping and make your catalog available , publish product pins , and drive traffic to your online store .   due to the traffic they manage , social media platforms are rapidly shifting to support the ecommerce industry . so they ’re not only helpful to build brand awareness and promote marketing campaigns , but to drive sales too .   4 . unique digital platforms   ecommerce is also taking place on other less centralized platforms . and they ’re important because these are the types of businesses that allow individuals to build their own audience in unique ways — and from anywhere in the world .   some examples include :   course platforms such as gumroad or podia , where you can quickly put your own courses on sale , build a landing page , and promote it on your sales channels such as twitter or facebook .   premium newsletter platforms like substack , where you can create your personal newsletter and charge subscribers a monthly fee to receive your email content .   no code tools like bubble.io , where you can build a software product without being a software developer and launch a saas. there is no need to code or have any technical skills to create a minimum - viable product .   and this is just the tip of the iceberg . the internet is flooded with platforms where you can provide products or services online ( and make a living ) .   5 . decentralized commerce   given the development of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies , there has been a lot of buzz around the “ web3 ” , which is a decentralized internet where the user is in control of the platforms they use .   in the ecommerce industry , there are a few platforms in development that can potentially impact the future of selling and buying online . a pair of them include :   daos . standing as a decentralized autonomous organization , they ’re organizations run by code and where the stakeholders make decisions with votes using unique tokens . currently , there ’s a dao called “ the dao ” that offers “ borderless commerce ” to enable worldwide payments without regulatory hassles and integrate it with your store .   nfts marketplaces . non - fungible tokens are individual currencies often tied to a specific document such as an image , video , audio , certificate , or any type of file . as of now , there ’re nft marketplaces where people can publish and trade their own nfts , the most popular being opensea .   soon , blockchain technologies will be strong enough and shift the ecommerce industry toward a more decentralized environment — so it ’s a good idea to be aware of it now when it ’s in its early stages .   you can participate in the ecommerce industry too   you ’re reading this because you have internet access . and if you have internet access , you can definitely become part of this industry .   there ’s only one thing to do : to take action .   wherever you are right now in your ecommerce journey , there ’s always something you need to do next .   starting out ? learn how to build an ecommerce business and do it .   trying to get customers ? learn how to market your online store , and do the work .   trying to scale ? consult with us .   we have experienced ecommerce professionals who can help you implement the right strategy in this fast -

              " 'what is the ccpa and who must comply ? the california consumer privacy act explained . following the european union ’s general data protection regulation ( gdpr ) , and falling in line with the privacy laws of massachusetts , vermont , ohio and many others , california ’s controversial new privacy law presents the opportunity for businesses to level - up on privacy best practices . and for those cisos and it leaders who help manage their business ’s security risk and privacy activities , there is some work to be done .   on june 28 , the california governor signed into law the california consumer privacy act , and enforcement of the ccpa starts january 1st , 2020 . not unlike the gdpr deadline , there is growing interest in how to meet these requirements before the enforcement period begins , and similar to how businesses approached the gdpr , organizations are being forced to change how they operate because of it – and because of the fines associated with it .   most of the ccpa requirements are around disclosures and ultimately the discontinuation of selling california residents ’ pii – or personally identifiable information . the regulation outlines new standards for consumer data collection , as well as consequences for businesses that fail to protect this data . also included in the ccpa is a new set of rights that california consumers can exercise .   so who needs to comply with the california consumer privacy act ? the ccpa defines a “ business ” as a for - profit entity that collects “ consumer ” ( in this case california residents ’ ) personal data and meets at least one of the following :   the business annually buys , receives , sells or shares the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers , households , or devices . the business has an annual gross revenue of over $ 25 million . the business derives 50 % or more of its annual revenue from selling consumer personal information .   what are the penalties associated with the california consumer privacy act ? the ccpa applies to any business that collects data from california residents — regardless of where your business is headquartered . as for fines and enforcement , the maximum penalty of the ccpa is $ 7,500 and is reserved for only intentional violations of the ccpa . other violations lacking intent are going to remain subject to the preset $ 2,500 maximum fine . the largest financial impact on businesses is the ccpa ’s provisioning of the right of consumers to bring lawsuits to light . these situations may arise from instances where their “ non - encrypted or non - redacted personal information ” is breached , regardless of the harm done to the data . under the ccpa , consumers can collect between $ 100 and $ 750 for each event . if the damages are greater than $ 750 , then the consumer may receive even more .   how are the lawsuits filed ? a ccpa plaintiff is obligated to inform the california attorney general of the situation within 30 days of filing a ccpa lawsuit . the california attorney general is the sole individual who has the power to delay or block such individual litigation under the ccpa . ultimately , a small company can be impacted greatly from the ccpa penalties , while a large company will see effects but it may not be as harmful to business operations as a start up ’s result , for example .   more impactful for many businesses than the potential fines associated with the ccpa are the positive effects on the business ’s marketing programs and efforts to build consumer trust .   want an overview of how to approach the ccpa requirements ? watch cybersaint ’s chief product officer provide a step by step overview in our recent webinar .',\n",

              " 'why video is the best medium for microlearning . 3 reasons why video is the best medium for microlearning   let ’s go back in time 5 years . it was 4 pm and i was bored , frustrated , and confused . i had been staring at my computer screen for the last 8 hours completing a sales training elearning class . the first 20 minutes were exciting and engaging because i was looking forward to learning something that was going to help me improve my sales skills , make money , and help my company grow . the next 7 hours and 40 minutes made me want to throw my computer out the window .   fast forward 5 years to present day . not much has changed in corporate training or , for that matter , the corporate elearning space . yet , the world around enterprise learning is changing at an extremely rapid pace . there are 3 billion internet users across the globe , 6.9 billion mobile phone subscriptions , and 2 billion active users on social networks . the very employees that organizations are training can , in the blink of an eye , google or watch a youtube video to learn the skills they need to do their jobs .   if organizations want to better align with employees , educational content has to be just - in - time , easy to access , and broken up into shorter , more easily digestible pieces . enter microlearning : for a full definition and 3 keys to making great microlearning , check out : why microlearning is hot in professional education .   now that we agree microlearning is where training is headed , the next most important thing to consider is the medium you choose to deliver your content . could it be possible that the medium we choose be more important to improve knowledge transfer than our beloved content that we ca n’t get under 30 slides ? the answer is yes . as marshall mcluhan , the great media philosopher , said in 1964 : “ the medium is the message . ” simply put , the medium in which you deploy content to your people is more important than the content . it ’s actually crazy to think about ! but let ’s not get too caught up philosophizing and get to the point .   since the medium can make or break your training , which medium should you choose ? the answer is video . here are the top 3 reasons to support this claim :   alignment .   75 % of millennials visit youtube monthly . millennials coincidentally are going to make up 75 % of the workforce by 2025 . but they are n’t alone . regardless of age , people simply prefer video over other mediums . according to neilson , video is the most popular content consumed globally . think about it ; if given a choice between watching an instructional video and reading a 3 page document , which would you choose ? retention and transfer of knowledge .   video is the most effective medium for communicating information in a short period of time . most people are visual learners , so combining visual examples with audio creates a higher likelihood of knowledge transfer . studies show that humans only retain 10 % of heard information after 3 days vs 65 % when visuals are added . easily produced .   because of the advances in cameras and software , video is the easiest and cheapest to produce than it ’s ever been . check out this one minute video we built using an iphone and the splice app to show how we make microlearning . it no longer takes an expert in video production to produce high - quality video that people want to consume .   one of my all time favorite quotes is from john wayne : \" courage is being scared to death .... and saddling up anyways . \" saddle up and commit to video as the microlearning medium of choice for your organization .',\n",

              " 'how to use an editorial calendar in your content strategy . great content does n’t just appear . powerful content is strategized and planned so that each topic has a purpose and value in the marketing of a brand . the right amount of words , style , and timing are crucial to the content truly hitting its mark with consumers . whether you have a personal brand or are working to promote a commercial brand , your content determines the success . is that enough pressure for you to create amazing content ? do n’t get overwhelmed with these types of requirements as you are probably more capable than you know of making this happen .     strategizing & planning for your ( successful ) editorial calendar   getting started with great content   it ’s no secret that planning helps promote success and one of the simplest tools behind a great writer is a content calendar . do world - renowned chefs just cook whatever they want for their guests ? do athletes exercise and train in a haphazard way ? no way . those who are experts at their craft , make a plan . in writing and content creation , an editorial / content calendar is the way to achieve this . it does n’t have to be complicated but any type of plan will work . before you start planning , take a minute to analyze your writing . here are some things to consider :   why do i write ? – this will guide you to determine the style of writing . if you write for fun , think about fun topics . if you write for current trends and news , think about recent conversations you ’ve had in your sphere and jot down those topics . if you write for informational purposes , read as much as you can about the markets and keep your ears open for juicy stories and details pertaining to that topic .   – this will guide you to determine the style of writing . if you write for fun , think about fun topics . if you write for current trends and news , think about recent conversations you ’ve had in your sphere and jot down those topics . if you write for informational purposes , read as much as you can about the markets and keep your ears open for juicy stories and details pertaining to that topic . how often will i write ? – every writer starts off their plan with lofty goals . “ i ’m going to write three times a week ” or “ i ’m going to have my team produce a new blog on a daily basis . ” be realistic with your writing routine and keep in mind if you or your team produces a lot of content in a week or two , it can be saved and spaced out .   – every writer starts off their plan with lofty goals . “ i ’m going to write three times a week ” or “ i ’m going to have my team produce a new blog on a daily basis . ” be realistic with your writing routine and keep in mind if you or your team produces a lot of content in a week or two , it can be saved and spaced out . will i add media to the pages ? – this is n’t a huge deal but if you have to take the time to search for pictures , word art , or other media to go with every piece , you need to have enough time and sometimes monetary resources to purchase the media . some websites will only hold a certain amount of pictures so if you are constantly implementing media to your blogs , it may clog up your site or cost you extra .   benefits of the editorial calendar   now that you know you want to write and why , it can be tempting to just make a note on your phone ’s notepad as topics come to your head . this is a form of brainstorming and it can be helpful but in the end , this “ willy - nilly ” approach to your   content strategy will not be effective . still not convinced , what if you saw facts about why a calendar will be invaluable to you :   you and your writers can work ahead . just like in school , when you knew an assignment was due and you wanted to go out with friends that night , you could study ahead of time and still get a good grade . the same is true with an editorial calendar . your content can be done ahead of the holidays , during downtime , and can be changed as necessary .   your content strategy will be current . when you plan ahead , your content can be moved around . for example , if you are writing about the similarities of the superbowl and business success , you may want to plan it for january / february time frame when the game actually occurs . more people can identify with it during that time and may even find it through an unrelated search .   you can measure the content success . as with any list or documentation , referring back to it can give insight on your marketing plans at that time . if you can look at your content titles , media used , keywords that were successful , it could be duplicated for another campaign . past success and failure can be measured when there is an editorial calendar to guide . according to beth kanter , this is the main key to successful blogs and marketing . it allows team members to collaborate and also to work on the same page with topics and marketing tools .   setting up the calendar   do n’t make it complicated . think about your editorial calendar like a menu for the month . mondays you are offering one thing , tuesdays another , and so on . check out contently ’s blog with very useful tips about this . it can be helpful to have a brainstorming session to establish the tone and writer for each of the various topics . some writers work better with other topics than others so finding that niche for you and your team is crucial .   set up the calendar as a way to keep everyone organized and moving forward ; your writers will appreciate it and in the end , will probably stick closer to the deadlines . after all , what good is content if it does n’t get out on time ?

              " 'seo pricing guide : how much does seo cost in 2022 ? . seo is what connects your company to the majority of your customers . these days , 93 % of customer interactions start with a simple search engine query – often with no specific brand name in mind .   that said , you need to be integrating proper seo elements into your site , and one of the best ways to do this is to partner with an expert . if you have a tight budget , you are probably wondering what type of pricing for seo to expect .   so , how much does seo cost exactly ?   we know business owners are hoping for a straight answer here . you want a simple figure that will fit neatly into your monthly or annual budget .   the reality is that the cost of seo can differ dramatically depending on the seo services you need or want . seo package pricing differs based on many factors , such as the amount of content needed , expectations , projections for business growth , and the range of services required .   you should have a fairly good idea of what to expect when you get quotes for seo pricing from marketing agencies – so you do n’t get overcharged .   in this guide , we want to help businesses of all sizes understand how to budget properly for top - quality seo services – and avoid getting taken advantage of .   how are seo prices determined ?   to receive an accurate estimate of seo pricing from a marketer or agency , you will first need to provide some information about your business . this will help an seo marketer determine just how much work will be required , the type of content needed , and approximately how long projects should complete .   some of these important factors include ( but are not limited to ):   the current state of your search presence   the average revenue per sale   close rate of leads to sales   campaign goals   how quickly you want to see results   how the current marketing budget is allocated ( such as percent of gross sales )   this partly explains why seo pricing points can differ to such a great extent .   can you receive a quote for seo pricing ?   marketers should not provide an exact quote for seo prices without gaining key information about their clients ( mentioned above ) . you may see a fixed monthly cost for a certain seo package , but the marketer needs an in - depth understanding of your needs before providing an accurate quote .   what do most businesses pay for seo services ?   image source : spakrtoro   there are several different payment structures commonly used for seo pricing . according to a survey from sparktoro , 87 % of seo services offer monthly retainer charges , and 65 % charged either hourly rates or per project . just 15 % offered performance - based pricing .   this survey also found that the median cost per month for seo was between $ 2,500 to $ 5,000 per month for seo services . thirty - one percent paid above this range , up to $ 50,000 , and just 18 % paid less than $ 1,000 .   so , depending on how much seo assistance you need , it ’s possible to pay anything from $ 25 per hour for your service or up to $ 20,000 each month .   what is a “ reasonable ” price for seo services ?   a lower price can mean low quality of service .   for instance , you should be wary of a company offering their services for anything similar to $ 150 a month , particularly when you consider that pro seo specialists ’ average salary is around $ 50,000 per year . for such a low cost , a company is either relying on shady methods – such as link schemes – or will provide very little results .   seo services pricing can also be impacted by the type of professional you choose . if you want a pro with more than two years of experience , expect to pay nearly 40 % more per hour and over double per month . after just two years of experience , seo hourly rates can exceed $ 100 .   unsurprisingly , seo companies will , on average , charge close to double in comparison with freelancers and consultants .   do be aware that most seo professionals also charge a monthly retainer . according to an article from business 2 community , about 75 % of all search engine optimization professionals charge a monthly retainer .   the most popular retainer is between $ 2,500 and $ 5,000 in the u.s.   are monthly seo services the better option ?   the first fact we advise you to remember when exploring seo ’s cost is that it will be a constant service or solution you need , instead of a one - off option . aside from the goals and aspirations you have for your business , seo pricing is also impacted by the type of service you want . it ’s impossible to consider this aspect without exploring the issue of quality .   it ’s worth pointing out that most seo tactics require monthly attention , including link building and content marketing . seo is not a one - time project ; it needs to be constantly updated , analyzed , and adjusted to deliver the desired results .   content and links must be continuously upgraded and improved . this is why most business owners will be more than willing to pay a monthly retainer for a quality seo service .   how much does local seo cost ?   you are likely marketing to a local customer base . if that ’s the case , we imagine that you are probably asking yourself the question : how much does local seo cost ?   the good news is that local seo is comparatively cheaper than global seo services . you are dealing with a much smaller , more concentrated audience , and the competition is far lower . the best seo professionals charge , on average , roughly 23 % less for local services .   what types of local seo services are there ?   like global seo , the amount you pay will depend on the pricing models you are interested in and the search engine optimization package you need . generally speaking , local seo can be divided into three categories :   1 . automated local seo ( $ 300-$500 per month )   this is typically the cheapest option and will ensure that business information is provided to directories . this involves ensuring that all contact information – such as phone numbers , addresses , and email links – are correct on sites like yelp or yellow pages . however , this alone will not boost your search ranking , since this is merely the necessary information that google uses for geographical search results . however , this can be enough to gain visibility if you only operate in one location and want to target customers within a specific city or state . these services would involve updating all business accounts on location - based sites and incorporating necessary links and information customers commonly search for . it does not involve content marketing or social media management .   2 . small scale local seo ( $ 400-$900 per month )     these campaigns commonly involve creating highly targeted advertisements that run for a timeframe in a certain area . this often includes pay - per - click ads or social media campaigns that are highly localized to reach a geographic audience . small scale seo is designed for smaller businesses that service a limited area and only need to target customers within a certain mileage range . this is useful for keeping costs low while reaching a highly relevant audience . the key here is understanding how to optimize content to match local search intent and find clever ways to target audiences that meet the necessary criteria . while this is a bit more robust than automated seo , small - scale local seo marketers will help you cover the basics without getting into the real nitty - gritty of it all . this can be a great starting point , but it does not guarantee any rapid growth .   3 . comprehensive local seo ( starting at $ 4,000 per month )   this campaign offers more in - depth options covering all aspects of seo , including ( but not limited to ):   paid search management   content management   reporting   google my business management   social media   link building   citation optimization   management of online reviews       services like this are more transparent in providing you information on exactly where your marketing money is being spent . comprehensive seo focuses heavily on analysis reporting to track metrics – like online traffic growth , conversion rates , and visibility .   reporting services provided with these more thorough local seo services should focus on call tracking and conversions to help you clearly measure your roi .   other key performance metrics included in comprehensive seo tracking include : rankings , backlinks , analytics , paid search , competition , website health , google my business , reviews , citations , and social media engagement .   it should be no surprise that local seo packages will increase with more comprehensive services . however , they are intensive ; detailed marketing campaigns offer far greater value and higher returns .   what are other seo pricing factors ?   beyond the typical differentiation between company rates , seo pricing packages can be impacted by various factors .   industry   some industries are more likely to market online than others – and thus are more competitive .   if you look at the most expensive keywords on google , you will notice that lawyers , medical offices , finance companies , locksmiths , and car mechanics all fall into this category . other industries with expensive and highly competitive keywords include ( but are not limited to ) real estate , marketing services , software companies , and home improvement businesses .   image source : hubspot   in some cases , the cpc ( cost per click ) for these highly competitive keywords can be over $ 1,000 ! niche businesses tend to have the upper hand here since they can utilize longer keyword phrases or additional keywords with lower competition ( and prices ) .   the seo pricing for different industries is largely based on how many monthly searches a specific industry has .   for instance , a company seeing thousands of searches for their services a month will need to spend more on seo packages — additionally , companies servicing an area where many similar businesses will need to spend more to outrank others .   geographic location   everything from the population of a city or what part of an area you are targeting will impact seo pricing . even individual factors can have an impact . for instance , snow tire services would be more competitive in alaska compared to florida or southern california .   of course , more concentrated metropolitan areas will also have more competition . costs for localized seo packages in areas like new york city , los angeles , and chicago will be far higher than for businesses that only want to target customers living in small nearby towns .   type of service you need   seo pricing will often be determined by whether you want to optimize your site for organic search , build up a review profile , produce lots of content , etc .   this can determine which type of seo pricing structure is the best option for your business . for instance , if you merely need help setting up google my business accounts and optimizing site tags , this can be a one - time cost per project . if you need to build up a robust blog and want to gain higher rankings on the serps ( search engine results pages ) , monthly services could be a better choice .   current brand awareness and visibility   seo pricing can also change depending on where your brand currently stands in terms of awareness and visibility . if you are a brand - new company and starting from scratch , there will be a lot of leg work that needs to be done . on the other hand , if your business has been around for some time and already has an established search presence , you will need to focus more on optimization and maintenance .   how should you determine your budget for seo services ?   you might be wondering if ‘ how much does local seo cost ’ is even the right question to ask .   perhaps a better alternative would be ‘ how much should you be paying ? ’   when you look at different seo consultants , you should be exploring what you need to do to outrun your competition . even if you offer better services or products than your competitor , they will gather more online leads if their website ranks higher than yours on the serps .   according to a recent report from sistrix , 28.5 % of people click on the first link that pops up on the serps . 15.7 % check out the second , and the numbers dramatically drop from then on .   first and foremost – you must determine where you stand with your competitors and how much work you need to start outranking them .   how do you set a dollar amount for seo services ?   next , you will need to take a look at your current budget restraints about projected growth . you need to be both aspirational – but also rational when setting your goals . it is highly unlikely that you will double or triple organic traffic numbers within the first couple of months of running an seo campaign . however , this could be a good goal to set for the next year or two .   speak with the seo agency about the general budgets and roi expectations to have for your company . while an seo agency ca n’t guarantee a specific roi amount , they may be able to offer you predictions based on other similar businesses they have helped in the past . this can give you a better idea of an appropriate budget amount to set .   how do you determine your competitor ’s seo performance ?   how can you know what your competitors are doing if they are beating you in seo ?   many business owners think it ’s impossible to tell how well the competition is performing locally . but the truth is that it ’s quite simple .   first , you will need to complete some keyword research , exploring the top ten performers for your target keywords . exploring stats and data like domain authority can also provide a clear picture of how your competitors are performing – and what you ’ll need to do to outrank them . or , more importantly , how much you ’ll need to spend .   according to forbes : “ if a business ca n’t be discovered on the web , via multiple channels , then it ’s losing its competitive advantage . ”   do seo costs differ for small businesses ?   you would be right to assume that an seo campaign for small business owners can be comparatively cheaper than a large company or corporation .   seo agencies work to make tactics scalable , so hourly rates and fixed pricing are affordable for diverse clients . indeed , according to one survey , more than 40 % of seo agencies offer multiple pricing models .   multiple pricing models allow business owners to choose the solution that fits their needs . for instance , you can pay hourly and expect anything between $ 125-$150 . alternatively , fixed - priced services can be anything between $ 500 up to $ 7,500 per month .   or , you can choose a project - based package and expect to pay around $ 1,000 for various services . again , these prices are determined by the previously mentioned seo pricing factors and can vary for each business and project type .   again , small business owners have no fixed cost to fall back on when asking : “ how much does seo cost for small business needs ? ” instead , we recommend that you aim to spend at least $ 500 per month on seo to see results and improvements that you can take to the bank .   what should you do if your budget is tight ?   many small business owners make one mistake looking at seo as a cost or even as a risk . instead , seo should be considered a long - term investment providing continuous value to you and your business .   just think about the power a fantastic piece of content on your website can have . according to wordstream , “ compared to traditional marketing programs , content marketing costs 62 % less and generates approximately three times the leads ’ volume . ”   paying for a talented seo marketer to create a high - level piece of optimized content for your site can drive in new leads for years and years . so , the one - time payment can pay off in the long run .   while $ 500 is the bare minimum you should pay , small business owners should aim to expand their budget to somewhere between $ 1000 and $ 5000 for their monthly budget of seo .   remember , more experienced seo professionals will provide a scalable service without missing any crucial elements , such as :   quality content creation   link building   conversion rate optimization   accessibility and usability of your website   customer review management   should you increase your seo spending budget over time ?   paying upwards of $ 10,000 per month will provide a fully - managed seo marketing campaign for your business . ultimately , this will allow you to completely forget about promotion and leave it to an experienced team . you might be surprised to learn companies can spend up to $ 100 k per month on seo – depending on the keywords targeted and level of competition .   so , high - quality seo services can be cost - effective and provide a fantastic roi . also , note that it can take a while before you start to see measurable results from seo . this is a marathon , not a sprint . the more effort you put into content creation , keyword inclusion , link - building , and other seo strategies , you will see better results .   what ’s the return of investments of seo ?   there is no guaranteed roi ( return on investment ) for seo services . in fact , if an seo agency gives you a guarantee of results , you should run !   the good news is most companies see positive results from seo . according to internal research from first page sage , the majority of clients who invest in seo marketing have compounding returns over the first three years . however , the average return rates depend greatly on the types of services as well as the industry of the company .   for instance , technical seo work ( keyword research , title tag rewrites , technical fixes ) had an average roi of 117 % , whereas content - based seo had a 748 % roi .   image source : firstpagesage.com   seo is dependent on many different factors – many of which are out of yours and the seo agency ’s control . additionally , seo work takes time to reap the benefits . you probably wo n’t see an instant boost in traffic numbers right after you restructure your content .   while there is never a promised rate of return for seo , the key is to be patient and consistent . most companies begin to see returns within six months to a year of launching their seo campaign .   conclusion   we hope this provides you with an insider ’s account and allows you to understand the seo pricing structures and the factors that impact how much you ’ll pay . there is no one - size - fits - all budget for businesses that require seo services . the cost is based on numerous factors – but the more that you are able ( and willing ) to spend on top - quality work , the greater the results and roi can be .   at foxxr digital marketing , we provide scalable , professional seo services and solutions to suit your business budget . with our expertise , you can outrank your competition without breaking the bank . get in touch today or fill out a form , and we ’ll put together the perfect seo package for you .   published : jul 15 , 2019   updated : june 27 , 2022',\n",

              " \"3 ways guest posting can help grow your online audience . these days , i 'm writing guest posts like a madman . more than i ever have , in fact , in over six years of steady blogging . in addition to my commitment to regularly posting on this blog , it 's quite an investment of time . so why bother ?   i believe guest posting is the single most important strategy for growing your blog readership and platform . allow me to explain …   what is guest posting ?   first things first : let 's define our terms . “ guest posting ” means writing and publishing an article on someone else 's website or blog .   i offer this on my own site ( occasionally ) and do it quite a bit on other blogs with audiences that i want to speak to . it 's a great way to connect with new readers and get your name out .   but for the longest time , i overlooked this essential discipline for growing a popular blog . i wish i had n't . and i hope you wo n't .   there are three reasons why guest posting is such a key strategy for every blogger to build their online influence :   guest posting builds relationships   bloggers need good content . by being a good guest blogger and adding value to someone else 's blog , you 're going to build relationships with other bloggers .   bloggers make up a large percentage of conversations happening on the internet , especially on social media sites like facebook and twitter . they can be tremendously influential . which makes them good friends to have .   by making friends with other bloggers through guest posting , you 're going to grow your influence in the realm of social media , which will ultimately lead to more blog subscribers .   guest posting is great for search engines   the one non - negotiable you should have for guest - posting is this :   the host blogger must include a link to your blog in the post somewhere ( usually at the beginning or end ) .   over time , these backlinks will raise the value of your blog to search engines , making your content easier to find via google , yahoo , bing , and others .   guest posting introduces you to new people   perhaps , the best part of guest posting is that it allows you to enter an already - established community , and share your message . it allows you to connect with new people , which can ultimately benefit you , if you do it right .   if you 're adding value to the discussion , you 're going to see that convert over time to more readers , fans , and followers . conversely , if all you 're ever doing is asking or selling , you may end up famous , but with a reputation you do n't want . ( you do n't want to be “ that guy ” who 's hawking his own agenda . )   add value . help people . be patient . and over time , you 'll win .   what about people guest - posting on your site ?   i 'm also a fan of allowing other people to guest post on my own site from time to time . you should consider offering guest posting on your blog , too ( if you do n't already ) .   if you 're asking for opportunities to guest post on others ' blogs , this just makes sense . it allows the relationship you 've developed with the host blogger to be mutual .   some bloggers will even blog about their guest post and link to it from their own blog ( giving you some great link juice ) . personally , i 'm a fan of this practice .   the first rule of being a good guest   when i guest post for someone else , i do the following :   link to the post from my blog   promote it on twitter ( several times )   share it on facebook   thank the person   stick around and respond to comments on the post   while not everyone does this , it 's not a bad idea . however , this is important : if you have to choose between getting people to guest post on your site or guest posting elsewhere , do the latter . it 's always better to get your name out into new communities .   guest posting matters   according to my friend , mike the search engine guru , when it comes to seo , guest posting on other sites is five times as valuable as creating new content on your own site . ( so long as you get the backlink . )   whether that 's precisely true or not , i do n't care . ( although , mike is not an imprecise kind of guy , so it probably is . ) the point is that this is an excellent strategy for extending your reach and boosting your reputation online .   plus , if you 're a writer wanting to land more “ traditional ” publishing opportunities , this is a great first step to eventually getting your writing featured in news sites , magazines , and other publications .   if you are n't satisfied with your blog traffic but are n't posting on other people 's blogs , you do n't have much to complain about . start guest posting today , and see your influence grow .\",\n",

              " 'how long should a blog post be for seo ? [ 2022 update ] . in today ’s post , i will give you the best blog length for seo in 2022 😱   but first , i ’m going to give you 5 things more important than blog length for getting insane amounts of traffic .   i ’ve used these exact strategies to get over 2,500 page - views every weekday to our blog at hook agency , and help our clients double their traffic year over year , consistently and like clockwork .   why did we do this research + write this comprehensive post ? we serve contractors and home service companies with marketing + web design ! check out our blog posts about plumbing leads , electrician leads , roofing leads , hvac leads , construction leads , remodeling leads .   more important than length :   there are a lot more ranking factors than blog length – here are 5 – and the data to prove it :   the number of outside domains linked to your website matters way more than the length of your content . keywords in subheadings seriously impact ranking . having a targeted - keyword in the first place is the number one most important thing you can do for your blog ! fancy youtubers and seo pundits might say , “ just blog about what you care about , ” – but i ’m sorry if no one is searching for that , it ’s a waste of your time , and that ’s sad . the blog that hooks the reader at the beginning wins in the long run – since “ time on site ” is something that google factors into what they algorithmically show the next time . if people ’ bounce ’ off your page quickly – then you ’re more likely to be displayed lower in the results the next time . later in this post , i ’ll give you 3 ways to get people to stay longer on your site within their first minute of reading . yes – human beings want shorter posts , so make it feel like it ’s short – i get that . a poll we did recently found that – 68 % of marketers are reporting that they believe 200 - 700 words is the ideal length for blog posts on their site . the important point is that you can make posts feel shorter ( but still give google the length it loves ) by putting bullet points , bigger paragraphs at the beginning , scannable headlines , and then have the post go on afterward . this way , you can achieve both the short and long post . lastly , 1,760 words – 2,400 is the absolute ideal blog length for seo in 2022 ( using a blend of 5 expert opinions and this graph below ) – but you do n’t want to hear that , so blog away about how i ’m wrong ! 🙂 also , keep reading for a dead - simple method to find the most ideal blog length for your site .   the best blog length for seo in 2022   the best blog length for seo in 2022 is 1,760 - 2,400 words . according to numerous studies over the last ten years – google ’s algorithm prefers more content when going head to head on shorter content posts – helping blog posts with over 1,000 words do better on average – and driving up the average significantly . at a minimum , blog posts should have 300 + words . having more than 300 words keeps your blog from being considered ‘ thin content ’ on your website .   other ’s conclusions :   many other articles from reputable sources indicate this level of effort is the new normal – here are 5 other conclusions for the best length for blog content ( in the last couple of years . )   1 . search engine journal – 1,900 words   2 . wesfed – 1,600 words   3 . moz- best length for seo is bs   4 . satish gonesh – 1,000 – 1,500 words   5 . buffer – 1,600 words   how long should a blog post be for seo ? the result of our original research in 2018 determined that the ideal blog post length was 1,200 + words . medium.com had reported in 2013 that the ideal length of a blog post is 7 minutes or 1,600 words . in short , the ideal blog length depends on your situation .   the elements to a perfect blog post   have a target keyword ( use ahrefs or semrush to identify things people are searching – ideally try to find items with a low difficulty ) use an image or a video towards the top to snatch people ’s attention . use bold or bigger text towards the beginning , a provocative question , a hot take , or promise value to get them to continue reading . you have to hook the reader ! use bullet points , and boil the main points down into the headlines for scannability . use the keyword at the beginning and end of the post , in subheadlines , and bolded – make it feel natural . name-your-images-like-this.jpg with keywords , and use alt text with keywords and a description of the image . support your key points with data and examples . make sure to answer ‘ shoulder questions ’ too – not just the main question they asked . use a short link ( url ) like this one /blog - length/ so that someone could share on social or easily change devices .   what ’s the best blog length for your site ? – it depends .   i ’m going to give you a dead - simple way to get your best blog length in about 3 steps in the next 10 minutes . i call this method the ‘ top ten average method . ’ it simply means taking the ten posts on your website that get the most traffic from search engines and determining their average length .   as for our top ten average method , some might ask : “ why such a simple method ? ” because i want people to use it ! what good are fancy formulas that involve powerful tools – if most people do n’t own those tools ? our longer method below uses screaming frog and walks you through a more specific option – but in a much more scientific and detailed way . before diving into that , i ’ve decided – it ’s more important that you do it than have it perfect .   need seo + writing services ? check out our plumbing seo , electrician seo , remodeling seo , and hvac seo services !   but it depends on your website – here ’s how to do the calculation .   when i did the ‘ top ten average method ’ – this is what my formula looked like :   33,192 – ( 125×10 ) = 31,942 / 10 = 3,194 words was our ideal blog length .   1 . first , find your top 10 posts in search by filtering analytics by ‘ organic search . ’   2 . then , take your top ten blog posts and determine their lengths using the bulk web page word count checker .   3 . determine the amount of content in your header , footer , and sidebar – for me , i got 125 words , so i subtracted that times ten ( 1,250 ) from the total of our top 10 blog post lengths combined ( 33,192 ) .   top 10 blog post lengths combined minus ( header , footer , sidebar length x 10 ) = corrected total top 10 blog post length divided by 10 equals your best blog post length for 2019 using the top ten average method .   what did you come up with using this method ? i ’d love to add to this post using the responses of people that read it – if you do n’t mind taking 1 minute after you get your result and dropping it in the comments below .   if enough people respond , i can add some additional content , rounding out some of this anecdotal research into a more in - depth piece of content .   how to focus on quality rather than quantity   the most important piece of blogging – if you ’re joining the blogging community or this seo - focused subculture within the marketing community , is that you create content ‘ of substance . ’   the anatomy of a perfect blog post   what does creating content ‘ of substance ’ mean ?   try to introduce new concepts in each of the blog posts you put out – do n’t just regurgitate facts that others have already shared . for instance , in this blog post , i came up with the ‘ top ten average method ’ because i knew it would be easy to remember , and perhaps it would make the concept of coming up with a website specific ‘ best blog post length ’ easier for the average person .   – do n’t just regurgitate facts that others have already shared . for instance , in this blog post , i came up with the ‘ top ten average method ’ because i knew it would be easy to remember , and perhaps it would make the concept of coming up with a website specific ‘ best blog post length ’ easier for the average person . think about what kind of media would enhance the content experience – there are a wide array of things that could help your reader digest the concepts you ’re sharing : videos , memes , gifs , diagrams , graphs , infographics , quizzes , and calculators are just a few of them !   – there are a wide array of things that could help your reader digest the concepts you ’re sharing : videos , memes , gifs , diagrams , graphs , infographics , quizzes , and calculators are just a few of them ! really consider what the intent of people searching for the thing you are writing about are looking for and how can you fulfill their need – one time , i wrote a guide about ‘ conversion rate optimization ’ ( the art of getting more visitors to do what you want on your website ) , and it got traffic for things related to ‘ converting files / optimization , ’ and i dumbly started to modify the article to be a little better suited for that term by adding variations of the keyword that would get people to click – but the article did n’t fulfill that need . so people likely left quickly and did n’t have a good experience on the site . that is n’t good .   overall , you want to increase traffic on your site for things that you are the best at and help people with – not just mindlessly increasing traffic for traffic ’s sake .   getting to 1,760 - 2400 words – 5 ways to find additional points for your article :   there are so many ways to increase word count , and yes – if you ’re wondering , i ’m feeling a bit of the pressure to make sure my article is as long as my ‘ top ten average ’ – so that this becomes one of my top posts as well . 🙂   but how does one do this without it feeling – forced or contrived ?   enter – lsi keywords to the rescue !   lsi keywords are other terms related to what you just wrote about and can allow you to answer adjacent questions , or speak on topics related to your main topic , thus helping people further on their search journey .   here are 5 ways to dig up these kinds of topics .   1 . look at what google suggests when you search in their search box :   have you covered all of the angles that these ‘ suggested searches ’ might indicate people are looking for ?   consider adding new elements to your post to cover some of these questions . for instance , by using this method in this article , i determined people might want to also know the best title length for blog articles because of the common query ’ best seo blog title length ’ … so i ’ll answer that now , it ’s under 70 characters – so that it does n’t get cut off in search results .   2 . use the people also ask box for seo   so now – in the ‘ people also ask ’ box , i see that people are asking ‘ does blog help seo ‘ – and i can offer a couple words about that . the answer is yes ! i ’ve gone from 100 - 200 people on my website to 1000 ’s a day just because of blogging , and many of those people become clients !   the concept here is that – you may not have thought of the questions people could be asking that are around what you just wrote about – so check out the ‘ people also ask ’ box for amazing and ripe questions to offer answers to at the end of your post .   3 . use ‘ lsi graph ’ to increase the length of your blog post with useful content .   after searching ‘ best blog post length for seo ’ in lsi graph , i got ‘ blog post length best practices , ’ ‘ ideal blog post length , ‘ optimal blog post length , ’ ‘ seo content - length , ’ ‘ 1000 word blog post , ’ perfect blog post length , ’ and ‘ average news article length . ’   although i might not always use these ‘ lsi keywords ’ to add items to the end of my blog post – i can get some context about some of the things people really want as far as content goes and perhaps identify additional angles . so , do you want the best practices ? 🙂   blog post length – best practices for 2022   1 . always do keyword research before starting your blog post . it ’s a shame to spend a bunch of time on something no - one will read , and no - one wants to write 1,500 + words without confidence that it at least * is possible * it could get 100 + people reading it and be long - term helpful for your ideal customers . amazing tools for this include ahrefs.com and semrush.com .   2 . always determine your ‘ distribution strategy ’ before starting a blog post . if your ’ distribution strategy ’ is n’t seo – and is facebook , linkedin ads , or any number of other methods – fine , but determine that before writing your epic blog post . that way , the promotion strategy and mindset can be built into the post from the very beginning .   3 . average the length of your top ten blog posts – and make sure most of your effort goes towards blog posts of this length , rather than just churning out short blog posts for the sake of frequency . why make articles no one will see in 2 years ?   why not finding your best blog length is a mistake   ‘ time on site ’ matters a lot .   “ if you are n’t on the first page of google for your “ money ” keywords , you ’re at a serious disadvantage . ” – sacramento seo – lockedown design   so the fact you ’re still with me – and the fact i put in the work to write an article that i wanted to be useful all the way to the end allows google ’s algorithm to see that this site serves up quality content .   that means – people that write 300 words … or people that write fluff for that matter , and do n’t do original research , do n’t include images , do n’t make videos , do n’t have ‘ co - citations , ’ or find supporting evidence for their articles – will generally see people jumping off their sites back to search results quickly .   the most important aspect of blogging in 2022 – determine your distribution strategy before each blog   even if the way you ’re getting the blog post out there – is not seo , you need to know how you ’re going to get 100 + people to see this post . if you ’re not lucky enough to have rabid fans that come back to your blog every day just to consume your content ( very rare , anyway ) – you need to either do keyword research and really have some solid keyword targets for the article … or you need to have an ad budget to promote the piece .   either way – we ’re too far in the game , for you to think ‘ if you write it – they will come , ’ your choices are keyword research – or generally spending other money in some way shape or form to get people there . to me , getting really good at keyword research ( or having us do it ) is a massive opportunity for most marketers today . if you ’re going to go deep on one skill in 2022 – my suggestion is keyword research .   the magical ingredient ? you need too fulfill keyword intent   why does long content work ?   comprehensiveness .   if you ’re writing a lot – the likelihood you provide the information someone is looking for goes up . and that all comes down to identifying what the ‘ keyword intent ’ is for a particular keyword and fulfilling on that .   here ’s how to do it in a short video :   other frequently asked questions about blog length   what is the average blog post length ? the average blog post length is 1,050 words ( source : orbit media ) . many folks feel like 500 is acceptable , 750 + is preferred , and 1,000 and above is minimum for many professional websites who take their publication very seriously . this , of course , is due partly to google ’s algorithm ’s seeming preference for longer content . how short can blog posts be ? some experts say writing short posts can be really good for generating comments if you ’re provocative with your questions or requests for discussion ! 300 - 600 words may be acceptable in these circumstances , though most professional websites do n’t accept anything beneath 750 words these days , because it does n’t come off as comprehensive a lot of times . it really depends on the subject matter – if you have a listing of images , gifs , or memes , for instance , 300 could be plenty and still keep people engaged on the page long enough for seo purposes . how long does it take to write each 500 words ? a 500 - word blog about a specific topic will most often take someone around 30 - 40 minutes . if you need to research , it may take longer . how many pages are each 500 words ? one single - spaced , or two double spaced . 1000 words are on average two pages single - spaced , and 4 pages double - spaced . if you get how this breaks down into larger amounts of words / pages , you can break it down quickly for any project that requires a certain number of words or pages for an assignment .',\n",

              " 'technical seo 101 : common reasons why you are n’t ranking .    the proper application of technical seo aspects can make or break your website but a lot of the common mistakes we see are easy to fix .   in this article , i ’ll break down some of the most common reasons why your site is n’t ranking as well as you want it to be .   what is technical seo ?   technical seo is the way you ’ve configured certain parts of your website so that it can be indexed for the web . it covers all of the nitty - gritty , behind - the - scenes aspects , such as crawling , indexing , site structure , migrations , page speeds , core web vitals , and more .   if you ’re at all concerned with how your site is ranking ( and if you ’re here , you probably are ) it ’s something that simply ca n’t be overlooked .   why is technical seo important ?   let ’s say your content is top - notch , but your technical seo is not up to standard . your site wo n’t end up ranking . this is because creating great content does n’t really matter if nobody can find or see it .   although search engines are getting better at crawling , indexing , and understanding intent , they ’re still far from perfect . therefore , good website content needs to be complemented by a strong technical seo foundation .   technical seo can also impact your website ’s lead generation , conversion rates , and sales .   this type of seo is important because , without it , your site will be improperly indexed . if this happens , google , bing , facebook , and other search engines wo n’t know when to show your site on search result pages .   performing a technical seo audit on your website will ensure that you have the proper framework in place so that all of the hard work you ’ve done on your site will be indexed and ranked !   let ’s talk about the most common technical seo mistakes and what you can do to fix them .   common seo mistakes   mistake # 1 : duplicate content   if there ’s one thing google loves , it ’s unique content .   that means that duplicate content is a huge problem if you ’re trying to rank on the first page of the search results .   use tools such as screaming frog , deep crawl , or semrush to find out if you have a duplicate content issue . these tools will crawl your site , as well as other sites on the internet , to find out if your content has been re - posted anywhere .   this could happen when someone else re - posts your content on a different url or if you have the same content posted on a page and on a post .   to combat this problem , make sure every page is unique . every page should have its own url , title , description , and h1 / h2 headings . your h1 heading should be a visible headline that contains your primary keyword . be sure to put a direct keyword in every section of your page to capitalize on the strength of your keywords .   you should even be careful when you reuse images and the alt - tags that accompany those images . while these tags should contain keywords , they can not be identical . come up with ways to incorporate the keywords while being different enough that your tags do n’t get indexed as duplicate content .   also , look for duplicate content in your structured data or schema . this is often an overlooked website aspect that can negatively impact your ranking . google has a great schema markup tool that will help you make sure that duplicate content is not appearing in your schema .   mistake # 2 : rel = canonical issues   you can use rel = canocial to help associate a page with another page . this helps to boost credibility and limit duplicate content without hurting your ranking .   it tells search engines that the page with rel = canonical is the one that should be indexed .   however , if used in the wrong place , it could cause some confusion and lead search engines to not rank your page at all .   go through the code on all of your pages to locate rel = canonical and make sure it ’s being utilized properly .   mistake # 3 : title tag issues   title tags can have a variety of issues that affect seo , including :   duplicate tags   missing title tags   too long or too short title tags   etc .   your title tags , or page title , helps both users and search engines determine what your page is about , making them an ( understandably ) important part of the optimization process .   to get your title tags just right , you need to start with the basics .   first , your title tag should be 50 - 60 characters long and include one or two of your target keywords . to avoid technical issues , make sure you do n’t have any duplicates on your site .   outside of the technical realm , a solid , click - worthy title will include :   dates   numbers   capitalization   emotion   mistake # 4 : h1 tag issues   header ( h1 ) tags are another important component of on - page seo .   while title tags appear in search results , h1 tags are visible to users on your page . the two should be different .   while it ’s not recommended to have more than one h1 tag per page , many are commonly missing altogether or are duplicated in the title tag .   big no when it comes to seo . always make sure you include one uniqueh1 per page .   to make the most of your h1 tag , make sure that it includes the keyword you ’re targeting on the page , accurately reflects the page ’s content , and is between 20 - 70 characters long .   mistake # 5 : not using meta descriptions   a page ’s meta description is a short snippet that summarizes what your page is about .   search engines generally display them when the searched - for phrase appears in the description , which is why it ’s so important to optimize the meta description for seo .   oftentimes , sites that do n’t utilize their meta descriptions ( or duplicate them ) will find their seo suffering for it .   for best results , always include a meta description ( if you use wordpress , this will be found at the bottom of the posting page ) , and aim for 150 words and make sure any important keywords are included before the possible cut off .   mistake # 6 : you ’re using meta refresh   meta refresh is an ( outdated ) way of redirecting users to another page .   these days , most opt for 301 redirects . google does not recommend using the meta refresh , and notes that it will not have the same benefits as a 301 .   moz has this to say about them : “ they are usually slower , and not a recommended seo technique . they are most commonly associated with a five - second countdown with the text “ if you are not redirected in five seconds , click here . ” meta refreshes do pass some link juice , but are not recommended as an seo tactic due to poor usability and the loss of link juice passed . ”   mistake # 7 : low word count   though simplicity and brevity are often desirable in marketing , too little text could cause your seo to suffer .   google tends to rank content with depth higher , and longer pages often indicate that .   try to incorporate more long - form articles ( 1500 - 4000 words ) throughout your site for better results .   mistake # 8 : hidden text   unnecessarily lengthy pages can slow down site speed ( they need to be really big though ) .   things like terms & conditions or location info can be meant for a single page , but end up embedded in all site pages .   make sure to scan your site using a tool like screaming frog to make sure the word count is what you expect and there ’s no hidden text .   mistake # 9 : incorrect language declaration   ideally , you want your content delivered to the right audience – which also means those that speak your language .   in fact , a site ’s language declaration is an often overlooked aspect of technical seo .   be sure to declare your default language so that google is always able to translate your page as well as know your location . your location can affect your international seo , as well as your technical seo .   to check whether you ’ve done this properly , use this list when verifying your language and country inside of your site ’s source code .   mistake # 10 : missing alt text tags   alt - text is great for two reasons .   one , they make your site more accessible . people who visit your site who are visually impaired can use these tags to know what the images on your site are and why they are there .   second , they are good from a technical seo standpoint , too , since they provide more spaces for text content that you can use to help your site get ranked .   mistake # 11 : broken images   a good rule of thumb is to always link an image . whether the link leads to another website or a different page on your own site , be sure to send the user somewhere when they click on each of your images .   images that lead to nowhere are a surefire way to increase your bounce rate , which will then affect your technical seo .   even if you are adding links to all of your images , you ’ll want to check them periodically to make sure that site errors or domain changes have n’t negatively affected your links .   broken images are common and often occur due to site or domain changes or a change in the file after publishing .   if you come across any of these on your site , make sure you troubleshoot fast .   mistake # 12 : poor internal linking structure   \\ufeff \\ufeff   internal linking ranks high in seo . and if you ’re not strategizing properly , it could cause some major seo problems .   to make sure yours is as effective as possible , make sure your pages connect to each other through practical navigational links with optimized anchor text .   mistake # 13 : broken internal links on your website   when crawling your website for indexing purposes , google depends on the internal links within your page . if these links are broken , it wo n’t know where to go next .   broken internal links also tank your credibility . why would users want to use your website if it ’s full of 404 error messages ?   to find broken links , use a tool like screaming frog . with this tool ’s help , you can enter your url and it will produce any broken links or 404 errors . once you know where they exist , you can repair or remove them .   mistake # 14 : broken external links on your website   much like internal links , you do n’t want links intending to lead to your site to lead an error message instead .   a lack of working backlinks will reduce the number of pages that appear in search engines .   just as you would for internal links , you can use an seo tool like screaming frog to scan your site for external broken links .   unfortunately , fixing broken backlinks is n’t quite as easy . because these are hosted on outside sites , your first line of defense should be to contact the site the link came from and ask them to remove it .   mistake # 15 : questionable link building practices   while link building itself gives an obvious boost in search rinks , doing so in a questionable manner could result in penalties .   beware of “ black hat ” strategies like link exchanges . yes , they ’ll get you a lot of links fast , but they ’ll be low quality and wo n’t improve your rankings .   other questionable “ link scheme ” behavior includes :   buying or selling links   automated programs or services   mistake # 16 : incorrect use of 301 & 302 redirects   know the difference between a 301 redirect and a 302 redirect and when to use each of them .   a 301 redirect is permanent . use this when you are planning to permanently replace or redirect a page to another location . this type of redirect will let the search engines know that they can stop crawling or indexing this page .   a 302 redirect is a temporary redirect . this code lets the indexers know that this page is currently undergoing some changes but that it will be back online soon . it lets them know that they should continue to crawl or index this page .   if you ’re planning to permanently replace or redirect a page , use the correct redirect so search engines do n’t continue to crawl or index a page you ’re no longer using .   \\ufeff \\ufeff   mistake # 17 : you ’re not using using custom 404 pages   someone might link to your site with an invalid url . it happens to the best of us , and unfortunately , causes seo problems in the process .   when that does happen , do n’t show the visitor a generic 404 error message with a white background .   instead , deliver a user - friendly 404 error message .   even though the page does n’t exist , you can still use your own color scheme and layout . you can also provide a link to your home page so users can search for the article or page they were hoping to access .   mistake # 18 : using soft 404 errors   when a search engine sees a 404 redirect , it knows to stop crawling and indexing that specific page .   however , if you use soft 404 errors , a code 200 is returned to the indexer . this code tells the search engine that this page is working as it should . since it thinks that the page is working correctly , it will continue to index it .   mistake # 19:,there are too many nofollow exit links   nofollow links have their uses . mainly the following three :   links to untrusted content   paid links   crawl prioritization   beyond that , you should n’t be overusing nofollow in your outbound links . some sites use nofollow in an attempt to prioritise internal spider crawling , but fair warning : google ’s not a fan of this .   mistake # 19 : there are too many nofollow exit links   nofollow links have their uses . mainly the following three :   links to untrusted content   paid links   crawl prioritization   beyond that , you should n’t be overusing nofollow in your outbound links . some sites use nofollow in an attempt to prioritize internal spider crawling , but fair warning : google ’s not a fan of this .   mistake # 20 : upper case vs. lower case urls   seo problems come in all shapes and sizes , or in this instance , cases .   this has become less of a problem of late , but still comes up for those using .net .   mainly , servers wo n’t always redirect sites using uppercase to the lowercase url .   if this is happening to you , use this rewrite module to fix the problem .   mistake # 21 : messy urls on webpages   when urls are automatically generated , search engine friendliness is n’t necessarily taken into consideration .   which is why you ’ll end up with messy , unintelligible urls like “ index.php?p=367595 . ”   it ’s not pretty , and it ’s not seo friendly .   try cleaning them up and adding in relevant keywords to your urls .   mistake # 22 : your server header has the wrong code   while you ’re performing your technical seo audit , be sure to check your server header . there are multiple tools on the internet that will serve as a server header checker .   these tools will tell you what status code is being returned for your website . pages with a 4xx or 5xx status code are marked as problem sites and search engines will shy away from indexing them .   if you find out that your server header is returning a problem code , you ’ll want to go into the backend of your site and fix it so that your url status code is a positive one .   mistake # 23 : low text to html ratio   indexers like content that loads quickly and easily !   text and copy make it easier for indexers to know what your site is about and which keywords it relates to . if you make it too confusing , the search engines wo n’t try to figure it out . they just wo n’t index the pages that confused them .   if you have too much backend code on your site , it causes it to load too slowly . make sure that your text outweighs your html code .   this problem has an easy solution — either remove unnecessary code or add more on - page text content . you can also remove or block any old or unnecessary pages .   mistake # 24 : there are query parameters at the end of urls   familiar with the overly long url ?   this often happens when certain filters are added to urls such as color , size , etc . most commonly it affects ecommerce sites .   i ’ve had this issue with a lot of sites … many times the parameters cause duplicate content as well .   the biggest issue here ? it uses up your crawl budget , so make sure you take the time needed to clean up your urls .   mistake # 25 : improper move to new website or url structure   updating and moving websites is an important part of keeping a business fresh and relevant , but if the transition is n’t managed properly , there ’s a lot that could go wrong .   mainly , a loss in traffic .   it ’s important to keep track of all urls and ensure there are no duplicates and that 301 redirects are directed properly .   for more on how to migrate your site and maintain your traffic , check out my full guide here .   mistake # 26 : your sitemap is outdated , broken or missing   sitemaps are really important as they are delivered to both google and bing webmasters to assist them with indexing your site .   they are super easy to make — in fact , most web design or hosting sites will prepare one for you . but this is also an aspect where your technical seo can fail .   much like your internal links , site index crawlers use your sitemap to determine which page to go to next . if this map is outdated , missing or broken , they wo n’t know where to go .   if they do n’t know how to crawl your content , they wo n’t know how to index it . if they ca n’t index your site , it ca n’t be ranked .   make sure your sitemap is up - to - date and contains any changes you made have made to your site ’s pages .   if you ’re struggling with creating a sitemap , a plug - in like yoast can make one for you .   mistake # 27 : your pages are n’t indexing   this one alone could save you a lot of trouble .   before you start diagnosing your possible seo problems , check to see your ranking .   all it takes is a google search .   type your site url into google to find which pages are ranking , and make sure they ’re the ones you want .   any pages you ’d like to rank for missing ? then it ’s time to dig deeper into the problem .   mistake # 28 . improper noindex code   another small code that could seriously jeopardize your seo is a misplaced index . using noindex will direct search engines not to index your site .   this mistake usually occurs in the website development phase before a site goes live , but should be removed .   if not , it can keep search engines from indexing your site . and if it ’s not indexed , it wo n’t be ranked .   mistake # 29 : a robots.txt file error   this is a big hit to your technical seo .   this is a big one to pay attention to when running down your technical seo checklist .   something as seemingly insignificant as a misplaced letter in your robots.txt file can do major damage and cause your page to be incorrectly indexed .   be careful when ordering your file ( or make sure your developer is ) ; you could have the correct commands listed , but if they do n’t work together correctly it could lead to unintended urls being crawled .   a misplaced “ disallow ” is another thing to be on the lookout for . this will signal google and other search engines to not crawl the page containing the disallow , which would keep it from being properly indexed .   you can test the health of your robots.txt file by using the test tool inside of the google search console .   a misplaced “ disallow ” is another thing to be on the lookout for . this will signal google and other search engines to not crawl the page containing the disallow , which would keep it from being properly indexed .   mistake # 30 : your core web vitals are n’t good   core web vitals are a fairly new aspect when it comes to technical seo but do n’t overlook it .   this google tool will tell you essentially how your website is performing . it checks whether it loads quickly , is user - friendly , and is safe .   you ’ll want google to approve of your core web vitals so it will give your site a high ranking . if google feels as if it can not trust your site , it will not recommend it to its users .   mistake # 31 : your website has a slow load time   if your website is loading slow , it ’s likely not ranking well , which can undoubtedly cause some major seo issues .   google itself has said :   “ like us , our users place a lot of value in speed — that ’s why we ’ve decided to take site speed into account in our search rankings . we use a variety of sources to determine the speed of a site relative to other sites . ”   luckily , site speed can be monitored and any issues should be dealt with as soon as possible .   to give you a resource on what speed you should be aiming for , semrush compiled the results from a study into the following :   if your site loads in 5 seconds , it is faster than approximately 25 % of the web   if your site loads in 2.9 seconds , it is faster than approximately 50 % of the web   if your site loads in 1.7 seconds , it is faster than approximately 75 % of the web   if your site loads in 0.8 seconds , it is faster than approximately 94 % of the web   some ways to increase site speed include :   enabling compression – you ’ll have to talk to your web development team about this . it ’s not something you should attempt on your own as it usually involves updating your web server configuration . however , it will improve your site speed .   – you ’ll have to talk to your web development team about this . it ’s not something you should attempt on your own as it usually involves updating your web server configuration . however , it will improve your site speed . optimizing images – many sites have images that are 500k or more in size . some of those pics could be optimized so that they ’re much smaller without sacrificing image quality . when your site has fewer bytes to load , it will render the page faster .   – many sites have images that are 500k or more in size . some of those pics could be optimized so that they ’re much smaller without sacrificing image quality . when your site has fewer bytes to load , it will render the page faster . leveraging browser caching – if you ’re using wordpress , you can grab a plugin that will enable you to use browser caching . that helps users who revisit your site because they ’ll load resources ( like images ) from their hard drive instead of over the network .   – if you ’re using wordpress , you can grab a plugin that will enable you to use browser caching . that helps users who revisit your site because they ’ll load resources ( like images ) from their hard drive instead of over the network . using a cdn – a content delivery network ( cdn ) will deliver content quickly to your visitors by loading it from a node that ’s close to their location . the downside is the cost . cdns can be expensive . but if you ’re concerned about user experience , they might be worth it .   mistake # 32 : poor mobile experience   these days , this one ’s a no - brainer .   in 2016 , google announced its intention to start mobile - first indexing :   “ to make our results more useful , we ’ve begun experiments to make our index mobile - first . although our search index will continue to be a single index of websites and apps , our algorithms will eventually primarily use the mobile version of a site ’s content to rank pages from that site , to understand structured data , and to show snippets from those pages in our results . ”   to properly optimize for mobile , you must take everything from site design and structure to use of flash and page speed into consideration .   mistake # 33 : your website has poor navigation   if users ca n’t easily navigate your site , they ’re unlikely to engage and will prove less useful to visitors .   in turn , that could lead search engines to consider your site to have low authority , which will adversely affect your rankings .   mistake # 34 : still using http   since web security is always on everyone ’s minds , all indexed sites now use https .   a recent announcement from google stated that they would soon start marking any non - https sites as non - secure if they require credit cards or passwords .   search engines do n’t want to harm their own credibility by sending their users to non - secure sites . if your website is not secure , they just wo n’t index it .   using an http site is a fatal mistake when it comes to your technical seo .   mistake # 35 : you ’re not using local search and structured data markup   local searches drive a lot of search engine queries , and google certainly recognizes that .   this is why a presence on search data providers like yelp , facebook , etc . is essential , as well as your own google my business page . make sure your contact information is consistent on all pages .   mistake # 36 : multiple versions of homepage   we ’ve discussed previously that duplicate content presents a problem but that problem grows even bigger when it ’s your homepage that ’s duplicated .   you ’ll want to make sure that you do n’t have multiple versions ( www and non - www , .index.html versions , etc . ) of your homepage .   you can find out if this is happening with your site by simply googling site : [ insert version of the site you ’re looking for ] . the results that come back will tell you if those versions are live or indexed .   if you do find out that multiple versions of your site are live , add a 301 redirect to the duplicate page to point search engines and users in the direction of the correct homepage .   mistake # 37 : you ’re not using breadcrumb menus   put breadcrumb links on your web pages . that ’s an especially a great idea if you ’re running an ecommerce site with lots of categories and subcategories .   you ’ve probably seen breadcrumbs as you ’ve wandered about cyberspace . they look like this :   categories > electronics > mobile devices > smartphones   each one of those words or phrases is a link . that means search bots can crawl them .   and they will crawl those links .   as a bonus , breadcrumbs also make life easier on your visitors . sometimes , they ’ll just want to go “ up ” a level or two and browse your website by following a different path .   wrapping up   to the untrained eye , technical seo issues are n’t easy to spot .   hopefully , this list gives you a better idea of what to look for ( and what can wrong ) on the technical side of seo .   if you suspect any of the above could be happening on your site , it ’s time to have a long look at your site and your seo efforts . and if you still have questions , feel free to contact us .   frequently asked questions   what is technical seo ?   search engines use a variety of ranking factors ranging from site speed and mobile -

of - view , delivering a mobile - optimized experience can earn you a green mark on google ’s mobile - friendly test .   core web vitals : these are performance metrics that quantify key elements of the user experience .   review https status codes : if your site still contains http urls , users wo n’t be able to access your site , making implementing https a must .   keyword cannibalization : this takes place when you ’re optimizing your home page and subpage for the same keywords , a practice most common with local seo .   what are the top technical seo tools ?   the market is saturated with numerous technical seo tools that can help with everything from keyword research and rank tracking to content optimization and backlink analysis .   here are some of ignite visibility ’s top picks :   google search console a favorite among marketers , web developers , and website administrators , t his is a free technical seo service from google ( previously google webmaster tools ) that allows you to monitor your site ’s appearance and troubleshoot technical errors .   his is a free technical seo service from google ( previously google webmaster tools ) that allows you to monitor your site ’s appearance and troubleshoot technical errors . screaming frog : with a customer base that includes google , apple , amazon and disney , screaming frog is one of the most popular tools for auditing technical issues on the market . the company ’s seo spider quickly analyzes websites of any size and delivers specific technical seo recommendations to users .   one of the most popular tools for auditing technical issues cloudflare : this free global cdn can not only speed up your site , but it can provide fast , cost -

              " 'the persona - driven keyword research process . this being my second time building an seo strategy practice from scratch i ’ve gotten to put a lot of what i learned from the first go round into play the right way . given the inevitable interagency interactions i ’ve gotten the opportunity to endure see a lot of different agency deliverables and for the most part i ’ve left the experience with the conclusion that the output of keyword research was lacking . well not just the output , but the inputs and the thinking behind it entirely . and i ’m not just pointing the finger at other agencies – i did n’t really know better either .   in most cases agencies are delivering huge lists of keywords and search volumes and that ’s it . if clients are lucky they are getting a prioritized list directly mapped to pages on the site . i see this as a problem for both paid and organic search although i think we can agree that ppc is rarely approached with the same surgical precision as seo so this type of thinking is typically not on their radar – but it should be . as we build our paid search practice we will apply these same practices to account for the audience .   the problem is a list of keywords and search volumes does n’t help anyone understand the user behind the search .   from this strategic gap was born the keyword portfolio and the seo copy brief , two deliverables that i ’d put together at my previous agency and brought over and improved here at iacquire with the help of my team . today we ’re going to talk about all the work that goes into the keyword portfolio and how i believe modern keyword research should be performed and presented .   standard keyword classification is still not enough   at best the industry standard for seo is to classify your keywords as navigational , transactional or informational . as i ’ve said in the past there is too much possibility for ambiguity in keywords to end the analysis or planning there . i think we can agree that there is a wide chasm between informational and transactional keywords and those classifications do n’t truly account for the consumer decision journey . everything seen as information is classified as high funnel and that ’s simply not always true especially when transactions are not necessarily a direct on site action . also need states may change while reviewing results of the same search .   so to truly understand what the user is looking to accomplish with their search we classify keywords by the personas that are most likely to search for and the need state that user segment is likely to be in . need state is typically defined by the phase of the consumer decision journey the persona is in . in some cases we will use a more specific need state , but the easiest cdj works well . for example the keyword [ how much is ivf ] may be relevant to a persona called “ nervous nancy ” who is in the consideration phase of the in vitro fertilization consumer decision journey . this tells us a substantial amount of information that will dictate content strategy rather than telling us what keyword we need to “ strategically stuff ” into a page .   from the meta description to the alt tags we account for the brand voice , target audience , and what need they are trying to fulfill with their search . people over robots , yo .   the process   before we get to the keyword research phase of the seo process we go to great lengths to get a firm grasp on our or our client ’s business goals . we of course build out your personas with , at the very least , very solid user stories , demographics and psychographics . many people have different notions as to what a complete persona consists of . i ’m not going to argue the values of market segmentation , but the goal is that you end up with a number of clearly differentiated archetypes for your target audience . whether you ’re building affinity maps based on assumptions , using qualitative methods like focus groups and street surveys or quantitative data stores like simmons , it does n’t matter . just do it .     keyword discovery – from any number of sources you can pull keywords as you normally would . this process is n’t so much about changing where your keywords come from . it ’s more about changing how you arrive at whether they are worthwhile and how you can present them in such a way that they are actionable for content strategy and campaign prioritization . here are the tried and true keyword sources : historical analytics – although the keyword intelligence continues to shrink , historical analytics is still the searing pan for keyword discovery . regardless of the search volume google is reporting and the ctr studies this is still the best way to know what ’s happening and to discover long tail queries that perform . of course in the era of 100 % ( not provided ) this will become less of an option . google adwords keyword tool planner – aside from running tests in adwords itself and finding out how many impressions are actually happening this is unfortunately your best source for determining how much traffic is available per keyword . take a deep sigh and go to the keyword planner and get what you can . ubersuggest – scraping google suggest , ubersuggest is a great tool for identifying long tail queries and although it is often hard to find that they have search volume in google ’s keyword planner , it is often good to gauge whether or not there is interest in a given idea . the guys at virante have a cool tool called ubergrep for adding the keyword volumes inline on ubersuggest , but it requires an api key from grepwords . bottlenose – this allows you to identify co - relevant keywords as they are happening in social media , much like the methodology i outlined a few years ago with the gofish tool . bottlenose is far more robust than my tool and gives you a list of tangential ideas and helps you understand the users behind the vocabulary . semrush – the tried and true tool for getting your competitors keywords as well as search volumes without having to go into adwords . semrush and grepwords also have apis that allow you to grab keyword data programmatically . google trends – although it does n’t give you any hard search volume numbers it does allow you to see the trend of interest and drill down into the location - specific trends . yahoo clues – rip yahoo clues . you were the only free tool that gave actual demographic data per keyword . it would be awesome if bing made better of use of its keyword data and the demographic data they can pull from facebook to give us a more robust solution . hint hint . experian hitwise – hitwise collects searches on the isp and toolbar level so it ’s a great sample - based look at both the keywords and the audiences going to those sites . for our purposes this is the most robust keyword data source and as you might imagine the most cost - prohibitive . data collection – you ’ll need to pull the following data points from your various tools : rankings – you ’ll want to know where your client stands currently for these keywords . at iacquire we ’ve inherited the nomenclature of conductor so we classify rankings into zones . hypertraffic ( 1 - 3 ) , traffic ( 4 - 10 ) , striking distance ( 11 - 20 ) , emerging ( 21 - 40 ) , developmental ( 41 - 100 ) . check out nathan safran ’s post on this topic . search volume – there ’s a number of ways to pull this . the wizards at seogadget have an adwords api plugin , but obtaining and maintaining an adwords api key without having an actual app that fits their criteria is hard to do . i ’m also not sure how well this works with all the recent crackdowns that google has been doing . previous period traffic – whatever previous period of traffic you want to pull whether a month , a quarter or a year . this will be used to compute share of voice . landing page – landing pages are important for understanding which pages are being targeted incorrectly throughout the site . this is also a good overlap point for our content audit deliverable . conversion rates – the truest show of value of a keyword is the rate or number of conversions for the previous period . this shows how well a keyword is meeting a given client ’s business objectives . keyword survey – using – using surveymonkey audience we put together a survey to get data that allows us to make informed decisions about who exactly in our audience is most likely to use a given keyword for a given reason . we generally pick the number of respondents we want to go after based on what the client believes is a representative sample . it ’s hard to predict as you do n’t know how many people will fall into each persona bucket , but by leveraging data from simmons we can predict what percentage of the audience each persona makes up and then put together loose survey projections based on that . the given audience will fit within one demographic range and sm audience allows us to specify this range . this is a key point where our data from our persona research comes directly into play . from here we develop questions that allow users to self - identify or even disqualify themselves as our target personas and using skip logic to ensure that users only answer 10 - 20 questions total .   we ask respondents questions about their searches specifically trying to identify their likelihood of using a given keyword and where they are in their decision making process ( consumer decision journey ) when they perform their search . in some cases we ’ll present open ended questions as well to allow them to fill how they ’d search in a given scenario in order to discover new keywords we had n’t thought of . naturally there are drop offs after a certain amount of questions so it is important to limit the number of questions that any user has to answer . ultimately each persona will fall into a branch resulting in a maximum of 20 questions total . survey design is a science that i do n’t claim to have mastered ( that ’s why we have market research professionals on our team ) and as such surveymonkey typically requires that users get the all clear from someone over there before they will run such an in - depth survey due to the number of questions we have . they provide a lot of great resources in the way of survey design best practices as well , but the main point i want to drive home in this process is that it ’s important to be incredibly judicious about the questions you ask . survey analysis & insight distribution – ultimately we extrapolate what we learn from the survey across all of the keywords we ’ve discovered . if we find that keyword x is more likely to be searched by persona y and they are in need state z then similar keywords are likely to follow the same schema . this is the point where the science meets art again . keyword portfolios typically have hundreds of keywords so you simply can not ask about each keyword .   out of the box surveymonkey audience gives a lot of great charting options and the ability to cross - tab of data points makes the analysis relatively quick and painless . however at some point you are likely going to have to take it to excel to set up pivot tables to really get down to the persona level on the keywords .   the deliverable   the keyword portfolio gives a much more complete picture of the keyword opportunity . depending on the client ’s situation the spreadsheet will have any of the following .   keyword   n - gram count   avg . monthly broad match search volume   avg . monthly exact match search volume   mobile broad match search volume   mobile exact match search volume   previous period traffic   previous period share of voice   previous period conversion rate   current google ranking   target persona(s )   need state(s )   keyword category   keyword sub - category   current landing page   target landing page   conversion rate   rank zone   most of these fields should be familiar to you except perhaps the following :   n - gram count – an n - gram is a keyphrase comprised of n words . that it to say a phrase with two words is a 2 - gram , a phrase with 3 words is a 3 - gram and so on . this is just another way to segment keywords and separate short , middle and long tail queries in filtering .   an n - gram is a keyphrase comprised of n words . that it to say a phrase with two words is a 2 - gram , a phrase with 3 words is a 3 - gram and so on . this is just another way to segment keywords and separate short , middle and long tail queries in filtering . share of voice – keyword share of voice is a quick and dirty calculation that speaks to the c - level . we calculate this by dividing the amount of traffic for the period by the amount of traffic you are likely to get from being in the # 1 spot . if you get an sov that ’s over 100 % that means you ’re in multiple positions or you ’re getting a ctr that is higher than the standard .   the end result of the keyword portfolio is a robust spreadsheet that makes it clear where the opportunity is in context of a brand ’s target audience , goals and competitive landscape .   keyword portfolio use cases   the main use case of the keyword portfolio is to drive content strategy and keep all content creators focused on users rather than robots . some of the other more specific use cases include identifying keywords :   landing on the wrong page   by target audience   by rank zone   by need state   by tail position ( head , middle , long )   by historical conversions   to prioritize based on campaign effectiveness rather than just search volume   that need to be consolidated into one page   that should be split into a new page   the keyword portfolio offers far more robust keyword intelligence for planning and execution than just a list of search volumes . that ’s what our clients deserve .   the caveats   as any market research professional will tell you , what people say they do is not necessarily what they actually do and therefore any survey - based data should be validated by true usage data . naturally there ’s several ways to do this :   experian hitwise – the latest iteration of this product integrates with experian ’s simmons service which means you can get keyword data in context with mosaic types . translation : you can get searches vs. personas based on a panel of actual searches . using this one could potentially skip the step of running surveys completely as you could simply get your insights from the canned surveys that simmons runs .   the latest iteration of this product integrates with experian ’s simmons service which means you can get keyword data in

leveraging cohort analytics is the ideal way to validate the market research before conversion happens . while you can use more than one social network facebook is the most robust demographic and psychographic source .   – although 100 % not provided is killing the search aspect of this keyword - level methodology , leveraging cohort analytics is the ideal way to validate the market research

leveraging site profiles which is a little easier to make happen than getting people to give you access to their facebook data . i talk at length about this in a recent moz post , but look to leverage sources like fullcontact and rapleaf to create invisible profiles and use those to validate personas .   another method of cohort analytics is leveraging site profiles which is a little easier to make

using cohort analysis . after all that ’s basically what standard seo does anyway .   as with any process , my team continues to perfect our approaches based on what we see working best for our clients . we ’ve seen some considerable lifts in conversion on clients using this approach .   when keyword targeting goes wrong   standard seo is generally about chasing a keyword with a good amount of search volume that has some relevance to your business . however when you take your eye off the audience ball long enough things can go very wrong .   let ’s talk about a time where i did n’t practice what i preach .   kristi hines , who has been a freelance writer for various blogs including this one for some time now , pitched an idea for a blog post about how to contact google . i was initially skeptical because i did n’t believe that our target audience was searching for that term , but the available search volume led me to approve the topic in hopes people would naturally link to the post . naturally , it did in fact generate 186 links from 19 lrds and ranks # 2 for [ how to contact google ] which would commonly be classified as an informational query . for us however it would be familiarity query , but it would not fit any of our target personas thereby making it a completely invalid keyword for us to target . without getting more data behind the decision i had no idea how disruptive to our goals that ranking for [ how to contact google ] would be .   the problem is that [ how to contact google ] was incredibly unqualified traffic that has resulted in a hundreds of people in my im window that think they have arrived on a google property . here ’s one of them .   ultimately , we ’ve added this large visual disclaimer to the top of kristi ’s post , but users have still jumped on the olark live chat to let us know their various gripes with skynet google . steve krug is probably pointing and laughing at me right now .     the next step is to either remove or noindex the post , but going through the persona - driven keyword research process would have showed us just how far off that keyword was in a way that could n’t be explicitly known by just guessing . it also would have saved us a lot of trouble and a lot of distracting instant message conversations .   however when we do focus on our audience and the obvious tenets of seo we get search impression increases like this :   our organic traffic conversions ( leads ) also looked like this :   use different data to combat ( not provided )   it ’s unfortunate that google is n’t going to give us our keyword data back . it ’s maddening that they are saying privacy is the reason they ’ve obscured it when it ’s clearly a way to monopolize search retargeting and/or turn google webmaster tools into a paid product . at the end of the day , that ’s fine , it ’s their website they can more or less do what they want . so complaining about it is a waste of time .   the reality of the situation however is that while keywords were always an advantage of organic search they are always just a proxy . keywords have always been positioned as a way to understand explicit intent of users and now we ’re being forced into cohort analysis and implicit intent . that is to say if you understand the people behind the search and you know what they landed on , you know what messages they are expecting and that is how you optimize in 2014 . your messaging and your user experience are the focus , not just your keywords .   after all this is the same process the search engines are using in the background themselves to better understand their own users ( see google ’s affinity segments ) . i encourage everyone to get in on the action .',\n",
              " 'google : why mobile - only indexing will cause the biggest seo shake up of 2021 . as 2020 wound down , and i awaited the delivery of my search marketer of the year award , i was honored to join the amazing aleyda solis and fantastic jamie indigo in contributing to the seo chapter of the web almanac . i encourage you to check it out because we uncovered a lot of interesting things about the web by quantitatively reviewing millions of homepages .   the most compelling insight that i got from our analysis was how often there is a material difference in content served between the desktop and mobile user context . directly from the analysis , we found a disparity between the median number of internal links being shown across the desktop and mobile pages .   from the above snapshot of the analysis , every percentile of homepages that we analyzed had fewer internal links shown for mobile than they did on the desktop experience . in preparation for this post , i asked tony mccreath , the australian technical seo ( and hairdresser to the stars ) that acted as our data analyst to pull a specific subset of the data where we had both the mobile and desktop page for direct comparison . what we found was somewhat alarming .   in our dataset of 5.3 million urls , we discovered that 30.31 % of urls served a different number of internal links for desktop devices than they did for mobile devices .   scarier still , we found that only 16.29 % of pages served the same word count between mobile and desktop . for the technical minded , the word count we considered is based on what is extractable from a rendered page using document.body.innertext .   we also took a look at indexability and found that 2.98 % of urls that self - canonical on desktop do not do so on mobile . there ’s also a subset of 0.51 % of urls where the opposite is true .   keep in mind that our analysis only looks at homepages . so if we were to take the time to extrapolate this out , i believe that we are looking at a major issue across the web .   why is this a problem ?   google made an official shift to mobile - first indexing as of september of 2020 . despite that , many of the sites i work on continue to show inconsistent distributions of verified mobile and desktop bot crawl activity . here are a couple of examples :   for a large and popular e - commerce site , they are seeing 58.27 % of their crawl coming from googlebot mobile .   we also have a large site that is one part publisher and one part marketplace that was switched to mfi as of november 2018 .   however , despite that indication in google search console , their crawl activity still stands at 75 % verified bots remaining desktop - first .   so , what ’s the deal google ? are we doing mobile - first indexing or naw ? if we are , why is so much desktop crawling still happening ? or , is it that you ’re still crawling with desktop for url identification because you know there are more links on desktop , but you ’re still using mobile rendering for the indexing process ? somebody get paul hahr on the line !   an issue is brewing   here ’s the thing , mobile - first indexing is not without its own set of problems . for a site that we recently worked with , their bot activity is nearly split down the middle . as a result , google is continually going back and forth between which version of any given page they want to index .   their desktop versions are incredibly robust and , as you may imagine , their mobile versions are quite pared down . the difference in word count ranges from a hundred to over eleven thousand words . similar things can be said about the internal link counts .   in cases like this , google has a frankenstein representation of a website in their index with an incongruent link graph and subsets of the content being featured . in simpler terms , you may be presenting a link graph that looks like this on desktop :   but due to the inconsistencies in crawling and indexing , google may index a link graph that looks like this for your site :   now apply the same idea to body copy on those pages . while it may be obvious , it ’s worth stating that any given page ’s relevance will inherently change by having a different set of words on it .   google representatives have indicated in recent discussions that indexing will become mobile - only as of march 2021 . in other words , all those sites that are rendering less content on mobile are about to have a bad time .   while much of the seo ecosystem is preparing for the core web vitals component of the upcoming page experience update , i find myself needing to sound the alarm about the content parity problem .   this is the real mobilegeddon .   seo ’s context problem   here ’s what we know . crawling and rendering are two separate processes . for organic search , this means there are four distinct contexts that google may currently consider for any given web page .   desktop html – the raw html version of how a page is delivered from the server to a browser   the raw html version of how a page is delivered from the server to a browser desktop javascript – the fully rendered version of a webpage as it is seen in the browser up until the document ready state   the fully rendered version of a webpage as it is seen in the browser up until the document ready state mobile html – the raw html version of how a page is delivered from the server to a mobile device   the raw html version of how a page is delivered from the server to a mobile device mobile javascript – the fully rendered version of a webpage as it is seen in the mobile browser up until the document ready state .   naturally , google experiences those user contexts with a googlebot user agent . for the purposes of seo , that means a non - googlebot version of that context is an additional version of each of those four contexts to consider .   while you may not see this often in the wild , any given webpage can be configured to react differently in all eight contexts . as a result , there may be cases where elements of the content and/or code are changed in material ways depending on the displayed context . in fact , depending on how a site may react to different browsers or phone makes and models , we could be talking about many more contexts . i ’m limiting it to the 8 to keep this discussion and the action items manageable .   specifically , what we need to consider are the differences in :   body copy   code structure   internal links   http headers   meta robots directives   canonical tags   some people might recommend reviewing the differences in metadata as well . you are certainly welcome to do so . the other items are likely to have a much larger impact , so i prioritize them over metadata .   seo ’s context problem is that there is no tool that surfaces this data for you out of the box . as i understand it , sitebulb has raw vs rendered comparison features between html and js versions of pages , but i ’m not aware of other tools that natively do this .   why ?   for the same reason that many tools did not do javascript crawling at all until recently . it ’s computationally expensive to crawl a url up to 8 times , store all the html , and parse its features . the cost of crawling would increase exponentially for analysis that often may yield no additional insights .   however , many people across the web may not understand the magnitude of this problem due to the fact that their diagnostic tools are not natively considering it .   how to diagnose content parity issues   uncovering content parity issues mirrors the approach you might take to determine whether or not you have issues with javascript seo . effectively , you ’re trying to figure out what it is that a given webpage is showing to a user that a search engine crawler can not see because the page may only be showing it in a context that differs from what search engine crawls or indexes with .   as google makes its move to mobile - only indexing , they are effectively whittling down the number of contexts that they consider . this actually makes the job of diagnosis a little bit easier .   while there are 8 user contexts to consider , you should start with comparisons between what is served to googlebot desktop vs. googlebot mobile . i will walk you through that step by step and you can extrapolate from there to fill out the remaining user contexts .   first , here ’s an excel template that you can use with the legendary screaming frog seo spider . even if you do n’t have a screaming frog license , the 500 urls that the free license affords should be enough to determine if there is a problem .   1.configure screaming frog to crawl using the googlebot mobile user agent without javascript rendering   2 . crawl a representative sample of pages . i generally do 10,000 for the sites i work on .   3 . complete your crawl   4 . export the internal tab   5 . configure screaming frog to crawl in list mode using the googlebot desktop user agent without javascript rendering   6 . switch to list mode and paste the list of urls from the first crawl   7 . complete your crawl   8 . export the internal tab   9 . open the crawl comparison spreadsheet   10 . copy the contents of the googlebot mobile export to the googlebot - mobile - html tab   11 . copy the contents of the googlebot desktop export to the googlebot - desktop - html tab   12 . copy the urls into the comparison sheet . it should populate the pivot charts   13 . review the pivot charts for comparison   there is value in comparing the contexts in a variety of combinations to uncover disparities . the primary contexts to compare against are googlebot mobile html and js because they will soon be all that google is using to ingest the web .   you can repeat steps 5 through 8 and add them to the additional tabs in excel and generate additional comparisons . for ease , here are the user agents that i use for the contexts above :   googlebot desktop html & javascript – mozilla/5.0 applewebkit/537.36 ( khtml , like gecko ; compatible ; googlebot/2.1 ; + http://www.google.com/bot.html ) chrome/88.0.4324.150 safari/537.36   mozilla/5.0 applewebkit/537.36 ( khtml , like gecko ; compatible ; googlebot/2.1 ; + http://www.google.com/bot.html ) chrome/88.0.4324.150 safari/537.36 googlebot mobile html & js – mozilla/5.0 ( linux ; android 6.0.1 ; nexus 5x build / mmb29p ) applewebkit/537.36 ( khtml , like gecko ) chrome/88.0.4324.150 safari/537.36 ( compatible ; googlebot/2.1 ; + http://www.google.com/bot.html )   mozilla/5.0 ( linux ; android 6.0.1 ; nexus 5x build / mmb29p ) applewebkit/537.36 ( khtml , like gecko ) chrome/88.0.4324.150 safari/537.36 ( compatible ; googlebot/2.1 ; + http://www.google.com/bot.html ) desktop html – mozilla/5.0 ( windows nt 10.0 ; win64 ; x64 ) applewebkit/537.36 ( khtml , like gecko ) chrome/88.0.4324.150 safari/537.36   mozilla/5.0 ( windows nt 10.0 ; win64 ; x64 ) applewebkit/537.36 ( khtml , like gecko ) chrome/88.0.4324.150 safari/537.36 mobile html & js – mozilla/5.0 ( iphone ; cpu iphone os 12_2 like mac os x ) applewebkit/605.1.15 ( khtml , like gecko ) mobile/15e148   check the documentation to see the latest on what google has indicated is in use .   meet parito   here ’s the thing , you should n’t have to do the process that i just walked you through . it is tedious and does not lend itself to scale because you will have difficulty crawling in parallel from your local machine . it also does not allow you to get a sense of where the disparities are exactly in the code . this can also be a challenge at scale for enterprise seo . so , i ’d like to introduce you to a new free tool that i whipped up called parito .   parito crawls every url 8 times , extracts features , and compares them against the features of the code returned to googlebot mobile - html . when you click into any url that it has crawled , it will give you the diff and http headers between the two contexts that you ’ve chosen from the dropdown .   the tool also visualizes the differences between contexts by showing the number of bytes per context above .   it ’s just a little something i whipped up . feel free to comment if you run into any bugs or have feature requests . also , shout out to our seo engineer , colt sliva , for helping me through some issues during the build .   let your website be a parity of itself   as always , i bring this issue up in hopes that the seo tools providers and/or the google search console team consider adding tooling like this to their respective roadmaps . site owners and seos sorely need scalable ways to uncover these issues .   i also think that it has been a mistake for google to push to abandon the progressive enhancement narrative for dynamic serving . progressive enhancement aligns better with the mobile - first ethos and would help us align around the idea of making content available to the lowest common denominator of devices . it would simultaneously solve all javascript and mobile context problems that we all navigate .   but , hey , this way certainly keeps me employed .   now over to you , what types of context parity issues have you seen in the wild ?   * * update one * * likely due to the parity issues that i ’ve discussed herein , google has pushed back the mobile - only indexing timing a couple of months . john mueller indicates that it could be april or may that it is rolled out .   * * update two * * screaming frog recently released version 15 of the software and it features native crawl comparison functionality . it allows the user to compare two crawls of any configuration that you decide .   * * update three * * november 26th 2021 : despite the focus on cwv and page experience updates , the mobile - only index has taken a back seat . according to a google search central post from john mueller :     “ we thought that we could complete the move to mobile - first indexing by march 2021 . however , we found that some sites were facing unexpectedly difficult challenges and we wanted to accommodate their timelines . we currently do n’t have a specific final date for the move to mobile - first indexing and want to be thoughtful about the remaining bigger steps in that direction . ”     additionally , he provides this guidance :     “ if your website has different mobile and desktop versions , you may see changes when we shift your site over to mobile - first indexing . if your website has the same content on mobile and desktop , you generally wo n’t see changes in how your site is shown in search . in general , this is a technical change with regards to how google crawls and indexes the content on a website . if your website is not in mobile - first indexing , and you have resolved any issues that your site has , you do n’t need to take further action . over time , as we continue to see sites become ready for mobile - first indexing , we ’ll start shifting these over again . ”     so there you have it . you still need to ensure content parity , but the official deadline for the mobile - first index has been delayed .

Patient centricity, at its core, is bringing the voice of the patient into clinical trial design right from the start to ensure the trial can achieve its objectives and endpoints while also creating a positive experience for the patients and their families. But what patient centricity really means and what it looks like in trial design is commonly misunderstood, and unfortunately, there are major risks for sponsors and patients when the understanding isn’t aligned.  Please join our Halloran-hosted virtual Town Hall on February 25th from 11:00am-12:00pm EST on “Hybrid Models and the Path to Designing Patient-Centric Clinical Trials.” Jennie Sheridan and John Ferraro of Halloran with be talking with Jane Myles, VP of Clinical Trial Innovation at Curebase, Mari Maurer, VP of Clinical Operations at Escape Bio and Alicia C. Staley, VP of Patient Engagement at Medidata Solutions on the opportunities and value of building patient centric principles into hybrid clinical trials.  This discussion will be led by team members at Halloran and joined by clinical operations executives and a patient to bring perspective to the following:  Defining patient centricity in clinical trial design and the risks of poor implementation  How hybrid model trials and technology elevate patient centricity tactics in clinical trial design  Hear a patient’s perspective about how hybrid trials are less burdensome  Understand strategies, tactics, and tools sponsor companies can use regardless of their budget  Identify common missteps sponsors make in designing their studies that might undermine patient centricity  We\\'re looking forward to another insightful conversation!  Get a preview of the discussion and read the latest article by Jennie Sheridan - \"Why Hybrid Trials May Be the Best Choice for Patient Centricity\"  Upon registration you will receive a calendar invite with Zoom info.

HOBOKEN, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Castor, a leading provider of clinical trial technology to democratize clinical research, today announced a full patient onboarding experience to enhance patient enrollment, from recruitment to first study visit.  The current patient enrollment process for clinical trials can be time-consuming and confusing. Building on Castor’s eConsent solution, patients can now experience a seamless transition on their journey from recruitment to screening, consent, and enrollment. A transparent, efficient enrollment experience lets participants know what is expected of them in the study - the better they understand their commitments, the higher study engagement and lower dropout rates.  \\u200b\\u200b”When designing our DTx study with Castor, we knew creating a patient-centric and simple process was critical,” said Karina Palafox, Director, Clinical Data Management at Click Therapeutics. “Thanks to Castor, we were able to easily integrate eConsent with ePRO, and EDC for our study needs; we believe Castor’s approach will help lead to trial success and account for patient adoption of our approach to decentralized clinical trials and Click Therapeutics study technology.”  Castor’s patient-focused onboarding process is completed entirely through Castor’s DCT platform, to support both participants and investigators remotely or on-site. An all-in-one screening and enrollment solution designed around the patient experience, Castor’s eConsent solution can:  Recruit patients with a dedicated and customized study enrollment web portal  patients with a dedicated and customized study enrollment web portal Pre-screen patients to ensure patients meet study criteria  patients to ensure patients meet study criteria Remotely or onsite consent patients with video virtual visit capabilities and digital signatures  patients with video virtual visit capabilities and digital signatures Upon consent, randomize patients and collect study data with Castor’s Clinical Data Management Platform (EDC/CDMS)  “About one-third of patients drop out of clinical trials due to a lack of patient-centric design. Castor’s cloud-based platform improves the early study experience of investigators and patients by decentralizing clinical trials. We have seen by simplifying participant enrollment, our study sponsors are seeing improved retention in trials and reduced recruitment timelines,” said Derk Arts, Ph.D., M.D., CEO & Founder, Castor. “We are at the forefront of digital health transformation, and our scalable clinical trial solutions can accelerate drug development and improve patient engagement.”  To Learn More -- Register to Castor & Lightship’s webinar: “It’s a matter of choice: Hybrid eConsent for On-Site or Remote Patient Enrollment.”  About Castor  Castor is a leading provider of decentralized and hybrid clinical trial solutions to democratize research. With the highest rated eClinical platform for decentralized and hybrid clinical trials, Castor’s plug and play platform offers rapid deployment at scale, enabling researchers to create a trial in a matter of clicks, with easy enrollment, consent and real-world data capture.
